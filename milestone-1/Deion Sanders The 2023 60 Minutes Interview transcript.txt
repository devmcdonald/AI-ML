0:04
conventionally 60 Minutes doesn't
0:06
profile the same subject twice in two
0:09
seasons but convention doesn't intersect
0:12
with Pro Football Hall of Famer Dion
0:14
Sanders last fall we met Sanders in
0:16
Mississippi where he was coaching
0:18
Jackson State to prominence in a
0:20
conference of historically black
0:22
colleges and universities then the man
0:25
who calls himself coach prime high
0:27
stepped it to Boulder to the University
0:29
of Colorado taking his blazingly
0:32
singular Style with him there he hasn't
0:35
just awoken a dormant program but has
0:37
transformed it into the talk of college
0:39
football if not American Sports Sanders
0:43
is revered he is reviled but a Sudden
0:46
Impact is indisputable for the second
0:48
time in two radically different
0:50
environments Unapologetic as ever he's
0:53
shaken the sport like a snow globe
0:57
the story will continue in a moment
1:02
are you the change agent are you the
1:04
ultimate change agent I make a
1:05
difference I truly make a difference I
1:08
make folks nervous man I give folks
1:11
moving in their seat I get folks
1:13
twirling their thumbs I get them
1:14
thinking and second guessing they said
1:16
you know have you ever been so clean
1:18
that you walked in and somebody looked
1:20
down at you then they looked at
1:21
themselves they had to check themselves
1:23
because you were so clean I have that
1:25
effect that's the vibe you're getting I
1:27
have that effect
1:31
that was some good game right there but
1:33
God that was good we ain't got next
1:36
we got now
1:44
[Music]
1:46
[Applause]
1:48
this was the scene in the locker room
1:50
two weekends ago
1:53
[Applause]
1:55
before the Colorado Buffaloes and their
1:58
new coach Dion Sanders opened the season
2:00
to 21 Point Underdog at PCU good job
2:05
Colorado was fresh off a 1 in 11 season
2:09
TCU was fresh from playing in last
2:12
season's national championship game
2:15
with skill and will the Buffaloes won
2:17
45-42 behind their Star Quarterback
2:20
shudor Sanders but the real Focus as
2:23
ever was on shidur's 56 year old father
2:26
it was his first win as coach of a power
2:28
five School the highest level of college
2:31
football do you feel like you were
2:32
underestimated if you come here and it's
2:35
I don't know if coach Prime can win you
2:37
must have heard what some of these other
2:38
coaches were saying both secretly
2:42
fear yeah that's fear that's like hey
2:45
man
2:45
shoot we don't want to let that Engine
2:47
That Could get going because if that
2:49
Engine That Could get going he gonna
2:50
start saying I think I can I think I can
2:52
the sooner the lady he gonna start
2:53
saying I know I can I know I can't then
2:55
soon the lady going to start saying I
2:57
did that
2:58
his Colorado debut Drew national
3:00
attention and monster TV ratings
3:04
interest compounded last weekend when
3:06
the Buffaloes played before the biggest
3:08
home crowd in 15 years in beat rival
3:10
Nebraska
3:13
this weekend both Fox and ESPN
3:17
dispatched their pregame shows the rock
3:19
included to Boulder then the Buffaloes
3:21
rallied late to beat Colorado State in a
3:24
double overtime Thriller
3:27
three games into the season the
3:29
foothills of the Rockies marked the
3:31
unlikely epicenter of an entire sport
3:33
what's this been like for you
3:36
um it's it's been a lot of fun
3:38
Rick George who hired coach Prime has
3:41
been Colorado's athletic director for a
3:43
decade it's great for us to be able to
3:46
bring this program back to relevancy and
3:49
we had failed in my previous nine years
3:52
10 years fair to call this bit of a Hail
3:54
Mary it wasn't a Hail Mary but it was a
3:57
moment in time for our University and
4:00
our athletic department that we were
4:02
either going to be relevant or we were
4:03
going to be irrelevant
4:05
it's too early to quantify the full
4:08
Prime effect but merchandise sales up
4:11
819 from last season Instagram followers
4:15
up more than tenfold season tickets sold
4:19
out
4:20
Sanders might be the ideal coach for
4:22
these shifting times in college football
4:24
another son Dion JR is part of the army
4:27
of videographers filming the team
4:29
non-stop for YouTube and an upcoming
4:32
docu-series
4:34
steam won one game last season is that
4:37
in a way a point of appeal God wouldn't
4:40
relocate me to something that was
4:42
successful that don't make sense to it
4:44
he had to find the most
4:47
disappointing in the most uh difficult
4:51
task
4:53
in this
4:54
is what it was and this is what it is
4:57
and I love that
4:59
this wasn't dissimilar to what he told
5:01
us last year that God had called him
5:03
collect to come to Jackson State
5:05
University and Elevate yes the football
5:07
program but also all hbcus
5:11
he stayed three seasons but the same
5:13
night last December that JSU won the
5:16
conference Championship Sanders
5:18
announced he was off to Colorado to
5:20
climb Another Mountain you left Jackson
5:22
State and you left quickness
5:28
leave quick I left what I was supposed
5:30
to leave
5:31
to leave most coaches get a new job and
5:34
they leave expeditiously I finished the
5:36
task you say finish the task was there
5:38
was there more work you could have done
5:39
in Jackson or I think we did a
5:41
tremendous job in Jackson I think we
5:43
laid down the tremendous blueprint
5:46
we tried to press Sanders on the
5:48
circumstances surrounding his abandoning
5:50
the mission at Jackson State he's hinted
5:53
the school's lack of Forward Thinking
5:55
may have factored in his decision but on
5:57
this topic he was about as elusive as he
6:00
was returning punts for touchdowns in
6:02
the NFL what'd you tell his kids when
6:03
you left
6:05
um opportunity
6:06
called sooner and later in life there
6:10
will be opportunity that knocks at your
6:12
door and at this juncture in my life I
6:14
felt like the opportunity for not only
6:16
me but for my kids as well was
6:18
tremendous not only did we take several
6:21
kids from that team
6:23
three trainers
6:25
maybe 12 to 14 staffers so we afforded
6:29
to give people a tremendous opportunity
6:32
here
6:33
the distance between Jackson and Boulder
6:35
is a thousand miles and immeasurably
6:38
further culturally Sanders went from a
6:41
city that is 83 percent black to one
6:43
that is one percent black from a place
6:46
with a Water Crisis to the kind of
6:48
hipster college town where there's a
6:50
shop devoted to kites what are your
First impressions
6:53
first impressions uh beautiful
6:55
unbelievable just the whole peace and
6:59
serenity of it all I never fathom coming
7:01
here I ain't never even vacation here
7:03
man I ain't never been skiing or
7:05
whatever you call it snowboarding or
7:07
whatever all the stuff you know ain't
7:10
never done none of that you don't even
7:11
fly fish no I don't I fish
7:14
I'm fly why I fish but I don't fly fish
7:17
still he wasted no time ingratiating
7:20
himself in the community including a
7:22
visit to Peggy coppam a 98 year old
7:25
Buffalo Super Fan
7:32
how about good looking this
7:36
he was less embracing of the incumbent
7:38
Colorado players at the first team
7:40
meeting in December Sanders encouraged
7:42
players to enter the transfer portal an
7:45
open market for athletes to find new
7:47
schools I promise you it's my job to get
7:50
rid of them and make room for Superior
7:52
Talent he planned to bring in more than
7:55
50 players eventually transferred out
7:57
you got here and you didn't pull punches
7:59
you told some of these guys have I ever
8:02
you take a team that's won one game and
8:05
you fired a whole coaching staff so who
8:07
did the coaching staff recruit
8:09
the kids
8:11
so the kids are just
8:14
as much to blame as the coaching staff
8:16
and I came to the conclusion that a
8:19
multitude of them can help us get to
8:22
where we wanted to go you told most of
8:23
these guys the more you jump in the more
8:25
room you're going to make those of you
8:27
we don't run off we're going to try to
8:28
make you quit yeah you made it very
8:30
clear yeah now if you went for that if
8:34
you were able to let words run you off
8:37
you ain't for us because we're old
8:39
school staff we coach hard we coach tuck
8:41
we're disciplined narrants so if you're
8:45
allowing verbiage to run you off because
8:48
you don't feel secure with your ability
8:49
you ain't for us
8:51
if some kid said you know what no I'm
8:53
staying you're not going to run me off
8:55
with your words right stay so prove it
8:57
I'm sure that your straight talk was
9:00
appreciated by some but is this scorched
9:02
Earth policy good for for college
9:03
football or for the kids I think truth
9:06
is good for kids we're so busy lying we
9:09
don't even recognize the truth no more
9:10
in society we want everybody to feel
9:13
good that's not that's not the way life
9:15
is now it is my job to make sure I have
9:19
what we need to win
9:21
that makes a lot of people feel good
9:23
winning does I got to push back on this
9:25
you're a father of college athletes yes
9:28
if they called you and say hey we got a
9:30
new coach and they're telling me to get
9:31
in the transfer portal I say son you
9:33
must be you must not be doing well
9:35
that's what you said you must not be
9:37
doing well because you should be an
9:39
asset and not a liability I'm honest
9:42
with my kids his kids include shador the
9:45
star quarterback in Shiloh of starting
9:47
safety if you guys have any idea that
9:49
you are going to be this good and
9:51
capture the country the way you have
9:52
yeah you did yeah we both didn't come
9:56
here
9:56
have our dad closing just to lose
10:00
a year ago to the day we watched the
10:02
door fleeing and Zing touchdown passes
10:05
at Jackson State
10:07
but there were questions about whether
10:09
he could do the same against stiffer
10:11
competition well in his first two games
10:13
at Colorado he threw for nearly 1 000
10:16
yards without an interception
10:19
you were putting up big numbers at
10:21
Jackson State you're doing it here
10:24
against teams and the Big Ten yeah the
10:27
big 12. must be gratifying yeah now
10:29
these two games was the most yards I
10:31
passed for in my career
10:33
so it's just it's just exciting knowing
10:35
that you know to translate and like on a
10:38
bigger stage I just feel better he's
10:39
also and again welcome to today's
10:41
college sports translated his success
10:44
into riches thanks to nil name image
10:47
likeness income so much so he drives a
10:50
one hundred and ninety thousand dollar
10:52
Mercedes Maybach and chidur might not
10:54
even be the team's best player Travis
10:57
Hunter also followed coach Prime from
10:59
Jackson to Colorado his coach lets him
11:01
play offense and defense virtually
11:04
unheard of in the modern college game
11:06
you've got two really good Heisman
11:08
quality players on this team yes your
11:11
son and Travis Hunter yes sir first half
11:13
of the first game of the season you're
11:15
already publicly talking about Travis
11:17
Hunter's Heisman chances who does that a
11:20
a coach that loves his kids the coach
11:22
that understands that's what those kids
11:25
desire and I supposed to do that that's
11:28
what we told them when they were coming
11:30
and choosing to play for us my kids that
11:34
play for me they didn't choose a
11:36
university
11:37
they chose me that's the difference
11:39
coaches have chosen to join Sanders as
11:42
well the staff he overhauled and
11:45
upgraded includes former head coaches
11:47
and former coordinators from schools
11:50
like Alabama now that you're a power
11:52
Five Guy mm-hmm who's the best coach in
11:55
college football today
11:58
let me see let me see a mirror so I can
12:00
look at it
12:03
you feel that
12:04
you think I'm gonna sit up here and tell
12:06
you somebody else
12:08
you think you think that's the way I
12:10
operate that somebody else got that on
12:12
me but I tell you this
12:14
I love and I adore and I respect and
12:19
every time I do a commercial with Coach
12:22
Saban it's a gift just sitting in his
12:26
presence and hearing him and and
12:28
throwing something else out there so I
12:30
could hear his viewpoint on it because
12:31
he's forgotten more things than I may
12:35
ever accomplish so I'm a student looking
12:39
up to this wonderful teacher saying
12:42
just just throw me a crumb of what you
12:45
know
12:46
for all the bling and Bluster there is
12:48
some humility and the current Mania may
12:51
die down a bit as Colorado faces a
12:53
Welter of tougher opponents the rest of
12:55
the season
12:57
but Dion Sanders has invigorated the
13:00
campus a program an entire sport game
13:03
ball Peggy
13:05
and damn if
13:07
fun give me my theme music
13:11
[Applause]
