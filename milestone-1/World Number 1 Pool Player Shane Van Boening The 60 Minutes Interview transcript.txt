name comes from pooling money to

like atick and chalk but that's as much

0:26
of it exists in the shadows well here

1:50
Pros amateurs and wannabes alike come to
1:53
the table for unofficial competition the
1:55
signs say no smoking and no gambling and
1:58
we sure didn't see any smoking tens
2:01
sometimes hundreds of thousands of
2:03
dollars Big Timber they call it change
2:05
hands until the sun comes up one player
2:08
we didn't see gambling upstairs Shane
2:11
Van bony a generational Talent known for
2:14
his killer
2:16
break van boning has won the US Open
2:19
five times and been named player of the
2:21
decade deaf since birth he wears hearing
2:24
aids and shuts down any question this
2:26
makes it harder for him to play
2:28
pool it's actually a big Advantage for
2:31
me how's that you know when I play po
2:33
tournament I can just shut it off do you
2:35
shut your hearing aids off when you play
2:37
when I want my first Uso and I had
2:39
everything off I was focused total
2:41
silence yes I'm totally like 100% zon in
2:47
never more zoned in than in 2018 when he
2:50
led the United States to victory over
2:52
Europe at the muscone cup P's answer to
2:54
golf's Rider cup and he is going for it
2:58
he closed it out with an off angle long
3:00
distance 1 n combo this highrisk High
3:03
reward pressure packed shot what a shot
3:07
Shane Van boning and Team
3:10
USA unbelievable finish think you could
3:14
have made that
3:15
shot we went to Rapid City South Dakota
3:18
a side pocket of America to Van Bon's
3:21
pool hall where he explained that making
3:23
balls disappear into pockets is only
3:25
half of pool Excellence it's also about
3:28
setting up your neck shot
3:30
Q ball control they call it and I'm
3:32
going to make the Q ball stop right here
3:34
so I can shoot the two in the
3:39
side then I'm
3:41
going you did that how how did you do
3:44
that just hit it right below Center so
3:46
now it lines up that next ball perfectly
3:49
yeah I'm so struck by the geometry of
3:52
all this yeah I love geometry it's all
3:55
about the angles van boning says he can
3:58
see every angle on the table a six sense
4:01
that comes from practicing as much as 10
4:03
hours a day shooting half a million
4:05
balls a year I want to make the shot
4:08
perfect the only way to hit it perfect
4:10
you got to do it over and over and over
4:13
can you be perfect in this
4:15
sport
4:17
no I tried so hard so all these years
4:21
van boning comes by it honestly his
4:23
grandfather Gary Bloomberg a known
4:25
trickshot artist opened pool halls off
4:27
I90 easy access for Hustlers passing
4:30
across the Great Plains but these rooms
4:33
were familyfriendly places so much so
4:35
Shane got his first pool queue when he
4:37
was two and went to the pool room every
4:40
day after school not just to play but to
4:43
escape kids who picked on him for being
4:45
deaf how bad did it get the kid would
4:47
start throwing Ros at me they would put
4:51
gum in my hair and then I would go home
4:53
to my mom I'd be going home crying you
4:57
know and then she made me feel feel
4:59
better by asking me you want to go to
5:02
the pool room why did coming to the pool
5:03
room make you feel better you know when
5:05
you walk in the pool room what do you
5:07
see you know you see people having a
5:10
good time but it was more than that he
5:13
had prodigious ability for thinking
5:15
multiple Strokes ahead when van boning
5:18
was 18 he hit the road he and his uncle
5:21
loaded into an RV looking for money
5:23
games came to play pool fats of course
5:26
they did the Hustler that stealth
5:28
roadman armed only with a wooden stick
5:31
in confidence divorcing the locals from
5:33
their cash has been romanticized for
5:35
decades not least by Paul Newman this
5:38
reporter was so taken by po hustling he
5:41
once wrote a book about it for Van
5:43
boning the romance hit the Rocks
5:45
abruptly yeah I actually was playing the
5:48
pool in Tennessee and I was playing this
5:51
guy for money and we were playing for a
5:53
whole lot and he was
5:55
losing and he picked up the key ball and
5:57
threw it at me where'd he hit you he hit
5:59
me right on the chest it's the kind of
6:02
thing you do to start a fight yeah how'd
6:04
you react I told my Uncle I said I don't
6:08
want to do this anymore I don't want to
6:09
live on the road anymore it's just too
6:12
dangerous here we go for the title he
6:14
chose to go legit and began playing and
6:17
winning proper tournaments though less
6:19
lucrative than the rambling gambling
6:21
life van boning enjoyed being a
6:23
professional did you worry that coming
6:25
in off the road was going to impact your
6:28
your finances
6:31
I know some of the pool players like the
6:33
top pool players were making money so if
6:35
they can do it I can do it but pool is a
6:38
deceptively tricky sport next up two
6:40
superpowers Collide just ask Shane's
6:43
Scottish counterpart Jason Shaw another
6:45
top player earlier this year Shaw holed
6:48
up in a Virginia pool room for 5 days
6:50
and broke the straight pool record
6:52
making 74 shots in a row the stuff that
6:55
happens in pool will completely screw
6:58
your brain up what do you mean you'll
6:59
see shots that and you'll be like how
7:01
did that happen you'll you'll hear that
7:03
all day how did that land over there did
7:05
you see that how that went in in pool
7:07
you see at every game something weird
7:09
will happen does that make it more
7:10
exhilarating or more frustrating both
7:12
mentally you want to like flip the table
7:15
at some point you ever flipped a table
7:17
no I've thought about it a few times
7:19
people come in how hard could it be it's
7:22
just a rectangle with six and then 20
7:24
minutes later there's still 15 balls on
7:26
the table they've not poted a ball and
7:27
the guy's like scratching his head like
7:30
thought this was easy it's
7:34
not we watched you at Derby City play
7:36
Jason Shaw Jason who yeah is he rival
7:42
yeah it's been going on for several
7:44
years now he's a great player and um
7:47
we're always going to have a battle you
7:49
okay with that yeah you have to accept
7:51
losing if you don't accept losing you're
7:53
just you're going to go crazy I'll stick
7:56
is the ice right here if having a rival
7:58
is Central to being being an elite
7:59
athlete so is this leaving time to clear
8:03
your head so it was we found ourselves
8:05
following Shane Van boning out on to
8:08
Paola Lake in the Black
8:11
Hills van boning goes fishing season be
8:14
damned every morning when he's back home
8:17
we didn't catch any fish we did catch
8:19
van bony's drift though his take on the
8:21
virtues of complete
8:28
silence vanity plate notwithstanding few
8:31
extravagances come with being number one
8:33
in pool the ragtag pro tour barely
8:36
televised in the US struggles to draw
8:38
much interest or investment outside of
8:41
pool die hards how many sponsors do you
8:44
have I have six sponsors cues and tables
8:47
and Pool Products yes and any sponsors
8:50
outside of pool no what can a top player
8:52
make top and pool can make only six
8:56
figures half expenses maybe five figures
8:59
no one's making a million bucks as a
9:01
pool player it never
9:03
happened van boning says cleaning up the
9:05
sport doing away with back room money
9:08
games would lure big corporate sponsors
9:10
big media deals and grow professional
9:12
pool we saw firsthand his discomfort
9:15
with gambling and all that comes with it
9:18
when we interviewed you in in dery city
9:20
I don't if you remember the the
9:21
interview was interrupted you you recall
9:23
what
9:24
happened oh the
9:26
gambling was that what happened yeah
9:31
it was morning at Derby City and the
9:32
action upstairs from the night before
9:34
was still
9:36
simmering they
9:38
arguing over the course of a few minutes
9:41
two players who' bet on a game nearly
9:42
came to blows you cannot gamble you know
9:46
van boning could only shake his head it
9:49
got to be a clean sport Ender prop
9:51
pool's unlikely new Guardian Emily
9:54
Fraser of the British sports promoter
9:57
matchroom the company recently revamp
9:59
Pro darts and snooker in the UK
10:02
streamlining their circuits and turning
10:03
top players into celebrities who make
10:06
millions oh that's where the tra sits
10:09
Fraser is tasked with doing the same for
10:11
pool and she says gambling is the least
10:13
of her worries what's the state of
10:16
professional pool today ah an absolute
10:18
mess why' you say that the first ever US
10:21
Open that I did in
10:23
2019 oh my gosh the players turned up
10:26
they were in jeans when I'm going hang
10:29
on a second like what's happening here
10:30
why is this guy turning up in jeans
10:32
Fraser has asked Pro players to dress
10:34
the part but she won't ask them to give
10:36
up their side hustles now all of the
10:39
basement tables and the money matches I
10:42
think that's brilliant and that can
10:44
still yeah I think that it's fantastic
10:46
because it's got the history behind it
10:48
you're okay if people are still they're
10:50
gambling and playing money games as far
10:52
as I'm concerned in a couple years time
10:54
they won't need to have any money it'll
10:55
be obsolete the market will do its thing
10:57
exactly but right now now it's not
11:00
viewed as this professional sport and it
11:03
has all the ingredients to be one she
11:06
standardize the format this is
11:08
commercialized sponsor friendly nineball
11:10
not the solids and Stripes eight ball
11:12
you've likely played in October at the
11:15
US Open held in Atlantic City Fraser
11:18
brought in bigger live audiences and
11:20
ramped up TV production she's kept one
11:23
pool Hallmark the Smoke Filled Room
11:26
close but no cigar there's a machine
11:28
puffing away in the corner When the
11:30
Smoke cleared there was Shane Van
11:33
boning he was fresh off winning his
11:35
first world championship sealing his
11:38
status at top the sport he confided to
11:41
us that he'd slept with the trophy for a
11:43
month van boning is mobbed at pool
11:45
tournaments but can still walk through
11:47
an airport unbothered well he's no
11:49
LeBron James and I totally understand
11:52
that and I recognize that um it's our
11:55
job to turn that around it is our
11:57
responsibility to turn that world number
12:00
one prize money from
12:02
$80,000 to a million so it's prize money
12:05
it's more events and let's get these
12:08
players known you've got to fall in love
12:11
with them are they lovable yes some of
12:15
them the health of the sport also
12:18
depends on minting a new generation of
12:20
elite players so this tournament had a
12:22
junior division held alongside the pros
12:24
and named what else the Shane Van boning
12:27
Jr open these are future Pros oh yeah
12:30
definitely definitely they have so much
12:33
passion for the game and then I'm going
12:34
to shoot the Shish back at the pool hall
12:37
in Rapid City we experience pool's highs
12:40
and lows in the same
12:47
hour didn't even let me hit a ball ever
12:50
the sports gentleman Shane Van boning
12:52
wouldn't let us leave without setting us
12:54
up to s a trick shot pool may or may not
12:57
clean up its act but any sport that can
13:00
provide this kind of pure simple thrill
13:03
just go right down the middle yep right
13:04
down the middle you reckon it'll survive
13:06
just
13:09
[Laughter]
13:11
fine you got
13:17
that
