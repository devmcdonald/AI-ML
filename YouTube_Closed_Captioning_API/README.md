## About
Foreign Whispers is a tool designed to transform your video content by adding both spoken and written subtitles in your language of choice, all while replicating the original voices. This powerful application harnesses cutting-edge AI technologies to provide a seamless and engaging viewing experience for diverse audiences.

### Features:
- **YouTube Video Download:** Automatically downloads YouTube videos to use as input for subtitle and voice replication, making the process straightforward and efficient.
- **Voice Cloning and Translation:** Clones voices and translates spoken content into your desired language, making your content accessible to many audiences.
- **Video Compilation:** Integrates the translated audio and subtitles into the original video. This process ensures that the final output maintains the videoâ€™s original flow and visual coherence while incorporating the new language features.
- **Audio Stretching/Shrinking:** To match the video length, the script speeds up the audio in specific sections. This ensures that the translated speech fits within the given timestamps for each speaker's segment.

### Issues:
- **Audio Speed:** Adjusting audio speed can result in unnatural sound, making it hard to understand.
- **Audio Artifacts:** Background noise and model variability can introduce random audio artifacts, affecting the clarity and quality of the output.
