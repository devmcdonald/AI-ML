Rich Paul has become one of the Premier
0:07
agents in professional sports he counts
0:09
LeBron James as a close friend and
0:11
client the agency he founded clutch
0:14
Sports Group made deals worth almost
0:17
$900 million this past summer for his
0:20
NBA clients alone Paul honed his deal
0:23
making instincts as a kid navigating
0:26
what he called the Hostile streets of
0:28
his Cleveland neighborhood today at 42
0:31
he's rewriting the playbook for
0:33
representing pro athletes Rich Paul told
0:36
us he was lucky and when you hear his
0:39
story we think you'll understand
0:43
why the story will continue in a
0:48
moment so did you used to come to games
0:50
when you were younger I went one time
0:52
when I had to um sit all the way up at
0:54
the top you really couldn't couldn't see
0:56
the person and
0:58
now now it's now you're sitting on the
1:02
floor we joined Rich Paul courtside at a
1:05
Cleveland Cavaliers game last season he
1:08
seemed to know
1:09
everyone what up do what's good and it
1:13
seemed everyone wanted to know
1:16
him thank you so much you're my ID bro
1:20
thank you brother I appreciate it last
1:22
year Paul got Cleveland star Darius
1:24
Garland a $200 million deal the richest
1:28
in franchise history Garland is one of
1:31
nearly 200 athletes on Paul's roster who
1:34
are some of the big names that we would
1:35
all recognize which sport you want I
1:38
mean we just had Jaylen herzon and
1:40
Devonte Smith playing the Super Bowl for
1:41
the Philadelphia Eagles and then you got
1:43
the Anthony Davis's and uh Draymond
1:46
greens and obviously LeBron do you know
1:48
the total value of the contracts you've
1:51
negotiated I would say it's close to 3
1:54
billion I think it's more than 4 billion
1:58
but it's hard to keep track when you're
2:00
always on the go showtime baby before
2:03
the NBA draft in New York City we
2:06
watched him work the phones you know
2:08
it's draft day man anything can happen
2:10
work the room hey coach how you doing
2:13
man right and work the angles to move
2:15
clients like Duke Center Derek Lively II
2:18
up the draft board you ready sir in
2:22
college Lively was known for his defense
2:25
but Paul had him work on his three-point
2:27
shot and before the draft invited teams
2:30
to see Lively shot up to the 12th pick
2:34
about 10 spots higher than first
2:37
projected it might not look like it but
2:40
Rich Paul is a towering figure in the
2:43
NBA I've always been the smallest guy in
2:46
the
2:47
room willing to take the biggest swing
2:50
some of his biggest swings have been for
2:53
his biggest client LeBron James Paul
2:56
negotiated his jumps from Miami to
2:58
Cleveland to LA a deals that netted
3:01
James $400 million and set him up to win
3:05
two of his four
3:07
championships he told us he works to
3:09
give players leverage some people say
3:12
that you're destroying the player
3:15
loyalty to the teams and the fans player
3:18
loyalty to what if I can be traded in
3:22
the middle of the night to another team
3:26
what I should be is educating myself to
3:28
where if this isn't going the way I
3:31
thought it was supposed to go I can
3:34
switch up right we're not I have options
3:37
I have op what's the sister to having
3:39
money with no
3:40
options that's apparently how Superstar
3:43
Anthony Davis felt in 2018 the New
3:46
Orleans Center had a $127 million
3:50
contract but was tired of losing so he
3:53
fired his agent and hired Rich Paul Paul
3:56
flouted NBA rules by publicly demanding
4:00
a trade earning the wrath of fans and a
4:03
$50,000 fine for Davis the drama landed
4:07
Paul on the cover of Sports Illustrated
4:09
which called him the most polarizing
4:12
figure in the
4:14
NBA when it was someone that didn't look
4:16
like me it was genius it was why you get
4:20
a power agent but when it's me I'm
4:24
destroying the league I mean those
4:26
things are absurd he got d us what he
4:30
wanted a championship ring and a deal
4:33
now worth $270
4:36
million there's a saying that goes if
4:38
you a got no haters you ain't
4:41
popping so you must be popping I think
4:44
I'm popping a little bit you know he was
4:47
popping a lot at his annual allstar game
4:50
party this past winter in Salt Lake City
4:53
is that we dropped in and saw giants of
4:56
the court mingling with rappers team
4:59
owners and Titans of Industry over
5:01
cocktails and canipes Rich Paul had a
5:04
full plate of business options one from
5:07
the president of Gatorade I want to be a
5:10
first call done while we were chatting
5:13
with
5:14
him Golden State Warrior Draymond Green
5:17
cut in the four-time NBA champion cycled
5:21
through two other agents before signing
5:23
up with Rich Paul who landed him a $100
5:26
million contract over the summer so then
5:29
you end up a young black man who's made
5:31
more money than you can ever imagine but
5:33
you don't know how to live with it you
5:34
don't know what to do with it and what
5:36
does he do most agents treat athletes as
5:40
if the athlete work for them but there's
5:43
a multi-billion Dollar
5:45
business going on around most athletes
5:48
that they don't understand but they
5:49
don't have a rich part to teach them and
5:52
that's what's special about it Paul's
5:54
improbable Journey the subject of his
5:56
new Memoir out this week started on the
5:59
east side of Cleveland in the early
6:01
1980s just as crack cocaine hit the
6:04
streets when he was about 4 he learned
6:07
his mother manura was hooked on crack
6:10
his father Big Rich recognized his son's
6:13
intelligence and kept him close though
6:16
they lived apart he owned the
6:18
neighborhood convenience store so your
6:21
dad's store was just right in here yeah
6:23
and this was this was my world this now
6:25
empty Corner was a hot bed of activity
6:28
legal and illegal it was a shootout
6:31
right here on this corner Big Rich
6:33
taught his son to always think two steps
6:36
ahead he scraped together the money to
6:38
send him to a Catholic High School away
6:41
from the neighborhood still there was no
6:44
avoiding the streets you don't know what
6:46
you're in that's your Norm that's my
6:49
Norm sardines out the can that was
6:52
today's version of tuna tartar on the
6:54
Waldorf
6:56
rooftop know this was my education
6:59
though this was this was my Harvard my
7:01
Michigan my morehous and the same things
7:05
I learned on this corner I take it to
7:07
the board room because the one thing
7:08
this teaches you that I don't think you
7:11
can learn from those institutions is
7:14
people
7:16
characters and on these streets it's no
7:19
better way to learn character because
7:22
they're coming with everything his dad
7:24
taught him another skill a way to make
7:26
money if all else fails with a Pair of
7:30
Dice Paul and his best friend Edward
7:33
given were regulars at an open air
7:35
Casino in the park 50 people crowded
7:38
around this little area and the energy
7:40
was high it was it was an arena and Rich
7:42
Paul was a natural and how much would
7:45
you earn I mean a slow day was $1,000
7:50
and a not slow day
7:53
H you know four or five $4 or 5,000 easy
7:58
when you were 14 15 16 oh yeah what did
8:02
you learn from this experience you gain
8:04
a resilience here we won majority of the
8:07
time but you also had to learn how to
8:10
lose he suffered his biggest loss when
8:12
he was 19 his father died from cancer
8:16
and Paul went all in on the streets
8:19
selling marijuana and crack cocaine this
8:22
is the very drug that your mother was
8:25
hooked on the absence of my
8:28
dad allowed me to to take that step
8:32
because I would have never done that had
8:34
he
8:36
been around I had too much respect for
8:39
him if it's not something that I would
8:42
sit here and and glorify it almost
8:45
sounds like you were a full-time Hustler
8:48
oh yeah but Jeff Bezos is a
8:51
hustler think he's not Phil Knight was
8:55
the ultimate Hustler the difference is
8:59
they could go with their plan and their
9:03
business
9:04
idea and get someone to believe in them
9:08
it didn't matter what idea I had there's
9:10
no Pathway to get there he found one
9:13
through a stroke of luck at the akan
9:16
Canton Airport in 2001 Paul was wearing
9:19
a throwback jersey like this one that
9:21
caught the eye of another traveler High
9:24
School hoop sensation LeBron James what
9:27
did you see in him it began with him you
9:30
know wearing a throwback jersey that I
9:33
you know loved but as we got to talk
9:35
about sports we started evolving and
9:36
even talking more and more just about
9:38
life and about our upbringing about our
9:40
our moms and and and our communities and
9:42
stuff of that nature and it um just kind
9:46
of struck it just struck a core when
9:48
James entered the NBA he hired Rich Paul
9:51
as a right-hand man Paul went on to work
9:54
for LeBron's agent and watched listened
9:58
and learned
9:59
I understand that you would go into
10:01
meetings with the likes of Warren
10:04
Buffett being in those
10:06
rooms is much better
10:10
to to listen than to talk if you listen
10:14
you might actually learn something and
10:16
you start to kind of you know work your
10:19
way on your own after just four years he
10:23
struck out on his own and launched
10:25
clutch Sports Group in 2012 LeBron James
10:29
went with him when you first started
10:32
this you were underestimated Not only
10:35
was I underestimated I was also not
10:38
wanted I didn't look like the success in
10:41
our industry especially from a place of
10:43
decision-making and I wanted to disrupt
10:46
the industry I wanted to be impactful
10:48
but I wanted to come from a place of
10:50
purpose in 2013 with his first
10:52
negotiation as agent for Phoenix Sons
10:55
guard Eric bledo he proved the naysayers
10:58
wrong he said the sons had offered $28
11:02
million and then $48 million and you
11:05
turned it down yeah but what was on the
11:07
line my
11:09
career everyone was calling and saying
11:13
he's crazy he don't know what he's doing
11:15
he's an experienced it sounds like you
11:17
are really comfortable rolling the dice
11:22
I was born a dice roller his gamble paid
11:25
off after hanging tough for a year
11:27
clutch got bled so a $70 million deal 42
11:32
million more than the son's first offer
11:35
great room today clutch has 70 employees
11:38
with offices in Los Angeles New York and
11:41
Atlanta and they both in the same draft
11:44
class Paul teamed up with Powerhouse
11:46
agency UTA to expand clutch's reach I
11:50
had to build a multi 100 million dollar
11:55
company to get people to believe in me
11:59
and there's still doubt critics say he's
12:01
only successful because of his
12:03
relationship with you I mean it's
12:04
disappointing to hear that would you
12:06
gave him an opportunity yeah and I don't
12:08
give people opportunities much um and he
12:12
took well Way Beyond um than what he
12:16
even imagined Rich Paul now has a new
12:18
balance signature shoe a first for an
12:20
agent his partner is more famous than he
12:23
is he's been in a relationship with
12:25
Adele for 2 and A2 years Adele she gave
12:29
him a shout out at the Grammys oh God
12:31
Rich he he said don't cry if you win
12:33
anything tonight don't cry and here I am
12:35
crying a couple of weeks later at his
12:38
allstar game party Paul's friends
12:41
recognized his achievements from us this
12:44
from us with a
12:46
$140,000 watch
12:49
wow
12:51
wow wow do you have to pinch yourself
12:54
sometimes all the time I had it worse
12:58
than a lot of people but I evolved I
13:00
matured I transitioned how's that feel
13:03
feels great it feels
13:05
earned you know it wasn't given for sure
13:09
it was earned which is good I like
13:16
that
