tonight Scott Pelley reports from
0:03
Ukraine where he sat down with president
0:06
velodimir zielinski in the capital keep
0:11
the story will continue in a moment
0:17
we met president zielinski as he
0:19
prepared to depart key for the United
0:21
States this week he will speak at the
0:24
U.N and meet President Biden it is a
0:27
critical time U.S officials tell us that
0:30
over nearly 600 days almost half a
0:34
million troops have been killed or
0:36
wounded both sides altogether
0:40
part of the cost so far of Vladimir
0:43
Putin's unprovoked invasion we spoke to
0:47
zielinski on Thursday he told us that
0:49
his people are dying every day to
0:53
prevent World War III
0:56
um
0:58
we're defending the values of the whole
1:01
world zielinski said and these are
1:04
Ukrainian people who are paying the
1:06
highest price
1:09
we are truly fighting for our freedom we
1:12
are dying
1:17
we're not fiction we're not a book we're
1:20
fighting for real with a nuclear state
1:23
that threatens to destroy the world
1:26
the United States has contributed about
1:29
70 billion dollars to your war effort
1:32
and I wonder if you expect that level of
1:36
support to continue
1:40
the United States of America is
1:43
supporting Ukraine financially and I'm
1:45
grateful for this
1:46
I just think they're not supporting only
1:48
Ukraine alone if Ukraine Falls Putin
1:53
will surely go further what will the
1:56
United States of America do when Putin
1:58
reaches the Baltic states when he
2:00
reaches the Polish border he will
2:03
this is a lot of money we have a lot of
2:06
gratitude what else must Ukraine do for
2:09
everyone to measure our huge gratitude
2:11
we are dying in this war
2:16
look if Ukraine Falls what will happen
2:20
in 10 years just think about it if the
2:23
Russians reach Poland what's next a
2:26
third world war
2:27
what will it take another 70 billion
2:31
yeah
2:33
I don't have an answer the whole world
2:36
has to decide whether we want to stop
2:38
Putin or whether we want to start the
2:40
beginning of a World War
2:43
we can't change Putin Russian Society
2:46
has lost the respect of the world they
2:49
elected him and re-elected him and
2:52
raised a second Hitler they did this we
2:56
cannot go back in time but we can stop
3:00
it here
3:02
Ukraine stopped the Russian advance but
3:05
at a terrible cost ruined cities
3:09
millions of refugees Untold thousands of
3:13
dead
3:14
all four Vladimir Putin's nation
3:16
building vanity
3:18
today the war is fought on a 700 mile
3:21
front the red area is the 20 percent of
3:25
Ukraine still occupied by Russia this is
3:28
where Western donated tanks were
3:31
supposed to punch through cutting the
3:33
Russian Force in half
3:35
but trenches minefields and artillery
3:38
stopped the armored Advance now it's an
3:41
artillery duel with each side firing
3:44
about 40 000 shells a day
3:48
Ukrainian infantry is advancing bloody
3:52
yards at a time
3:54
it's World War One
3:56
with drones
3:58
how would you describe the fighting at
4:01
the front
4:03
um
4:06
it's a difficult question I'll be
4:09
completely honest with you we have the
4:12
initiative this is a plus
4:16
the Russian offensive and we moved into
4:19
a counter-offensive but despite that
4:22
it's not very fast it is important that
4:25
we are moving forward every day and
4:28
liberating territory you have about six
4:32
weeks of good weather left and I wonder
4:35
after that point will the front be
4:37
frozen in place
4:39
we need to liberate our territory as
4:42
much as possible and move forward even
4:45
if it's less than half a mile or a
4:48
hundred yards we must do it we can't
4:51
lose time forget about the weather and
4:54
the like in places that we can't get
4:56
through in an armored vehicle let's fly
4:59
if we can't fly let's send drones
5:04
we mustn't give Putin a break
5:08
if the front is stationary Ukrainian
5:11
drones have vaulted into Russia itself
5:14
hitting the Kremlin warplanes and Moscow
5:17
high-rises officially Ukraine does not
5:20
acknowledge these attacks the drone
5:23
strikes in Russia are being done on your
5:26
orders
5:27
no not on your order well you know how
5:31
is this happening at the shore you know
5:34
we don't shoot at the territory of the
5:36
Russian Federation
5:38
we decided to try the question another
5:40
way what message is being sent with
5:45
these drone strikes in Russia
5:49
you do know that we use our partners
5:51
weapons on the territory of Ukraine only
5:54
and this is true but these are not
5:57
punitive operations such as they carry
6:00
out killing civilians but Russia needs
6:03
to know that wherever it is whichever
6:06
place they use for launching missiles to
6:09
strike Ukraine Ukraine has every moral
6:12
right to send a response to those places
6:15
we are responding to them saying your
6:19
sky is not as well protected as you
6:22
think
6:23
[Music]
6:24
last winter it was Ukrainian Skies that
6:27
were filled with missiles in a Russian
6:30
bombardment to destroy power plants
6:32
Millions shivered in the dark
6:36
with winter approaching again zielinski
6:39
had this warning
6:41
they must know if you cut off our power
6:44
deprive us of electricity deprive us of
6:48
water the privacy of gasoline you need
6:51
to know
6:53
we have the right to do it to you
6:57
Russia takes Solinski seriously now
7:00
because Putin's Mass invasion was a
7:02
fiasco the red marks where Ukraine
7:06
stopped Russia's Advance last year
7:09
it also marks the stain of Russia's war
7:12
crimes Mr President in traveling around
7:16
Ukraine for the last year and a half
7:19
we spoke to people in bombed out schools
7:23
in chernoheve
7:25
we've seen destroyed apartment blocks in
7:27
borodianca a bombed Hospital in isium
7:32
civilians in a mass grave in bucha these
7:36
are not military targets
7:39
what is Vladimir Putin trying to do
7:45
to break us
7:49
and by choosing civilian targets Putin
7:52
wanted to achieve exactly this to break
7:56
us this person who has made his way with
8:00
such bloody actions with everything he
8:03
has said cannot be trusted there is no
8:07
trust in such a person because he has
8:10
not been a human being for a long time
8:12
the Russians have suffered Grievous
8:16
losses
8:18
without resorting to nuclear weapons
8:21
and I wonder if you believe that the
8:23
threat of nuclear war is now behind us
8:27
I think he's going to continue
8:29
threatening
8:31
he's waiting for the United States to
8:34
become less stable he thinks that's
8:37
going to happen during the U.S election
8:41
he'll be looking for instability in
8:44
Europe and the United States of America
8:47
he will use the risk of using nuclear
8:50
weapons to fuel that instability he will
8:54
keep on threatening
8:56
that U.S election he mentioned worries
8:59
him his negotiations with President
9:01
Biden have been contentious at times but
9:04
zielinski tends to get what he asks for
9:06
even if in zelinski's opinion it's
9:10
generally six months too late
9:12
this week zelinski will press Mr Biden
9:16
for missiles with longer range Congress
9:19
is debating another 24 billion dollar
9:22
package
9:25
and if Ukraine had enough of these
9:28
modern systems we would have already
9:30
restored the territorial Integrity of
9:33
Ukraine we would have already done that
9:35
these systems exist are you safe here
9:40
we first met zielinski not long after
9:44
the invasion when his office was a
9:46
blacked out bunker be careful now a year
9:49
and a half later we noticed a difference
9:52
as we were setting up the interview the
9:55
former actor used his talent to mask the
9:58
strain he smiled at a compliment to his
10:02
wife yeah so great and then instantly he
10:05
seemed pulled beneath a depth no one can
10:09
know
10:10
we don't know what he was thinking it
10:12
looked like empathy
10:15
for the Lost
10:16
and for those who might be saved
10:19
[Applause]
10:24
our time was solinsky began in silence a
10:28
remembrance of the fallen during a
10:30
ceremony to award Medals of Valor
10:33
[Applause]
10:34
Ukrainian officials tell us Ukraine and
10:37
Russia have lost their professional
10:40
armies now the forces are made up of
10:43
volunteers draftees and in Russia's case
10:46
prison inmates
10:48
zielinski counts his dad in casualty
10:51
reports each morning you are the
10:54
president but it must be humbling to
10:57
meet those men I wonder what they mean
10:59
to you
11:03
yeah first of all it's a great honor for
11:06
me I look into their eyes and it makes
11:09
me proud that we have such strong people
11:11
because this is a big risk a big risk
11:15
you can definitely lose your life for
11:18
the sake of saving other lives and when
11:21
I say other lives I don't speak in
11:23
general I mean my own life the lives of
11:26
my children and I understand completely
11:29
what risks are involved
11:32
that empathy for life has velodimir
11:36
zielinski reaching out again to the
11:39
United Nations and the United States
11:41
hoping to convince the Allies that the
11:44
world can be safe only when Ukraine is
11:49
whole can you give up
11:51
any part of Ukraine for peace
11:56
no this is our territory you must have
12:00
it all including Crimea
12:03
of women
12:08

12:11

12:38
she was pregnant and that baby will
