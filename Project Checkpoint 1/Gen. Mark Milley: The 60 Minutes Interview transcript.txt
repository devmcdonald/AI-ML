General Mark Millie completed a
0:03
four-year term as chairman of the Joint
0:06
Chiefs of Staff the nation's highest
0:08
ranking military officer on September
0:11
30th he told us he spent most of his
0:13
time working to avoid a direct conflict
0:16
with Russia and China while the country
0:18
watched him have a very public falling
0:21
out with former president Trump the man
0:23
who picked him for the job General
0:25
Millie's times serving President Joe
0:27
Biden had its own challenges including
0:30
America's calamitous withdrawal from
0:32
Afghanistan as well as providing Ukraine
0:34
with billions of dollars worth of
0:36
American military equipment a few hours
0:39
before we sat down with the general at
0:40
the Pentagon he'd had his final phone
0:42
call with the commander of Ukraine's
0:45
armed
0:47
forces the story will continue in a
0:52
moment the counter offensive that the
0:54
ukrainians are running is still ongoing
0:57
um the progress as uh many many people
0:59
have noted is slow but it is steady and
1:00
they are making progress on a day-to-day
1:03
basis but expelling 200,000 Russian
1:05
soldiers No Easy Task very hard very
1:08
hard how long is this going to look like
1:09
this a year five years well you can't
1:12
put a Time on it but it'll be a
1:13
considerable length of time and it's
1:14
going to be long and hard and very
1:15
bloody Russia occupies 41,000 square
1:19
miles of Ukraine the front line extends
1:22
about the distance from Atlanta to
1:24
Washington DC in Congress this past week
1:28
Republicans ended Kevin McCarthy's
1:30
speakership and for now more Aid to
1:33
Ukraine according to the White House of
1:36
the 113 billion already committed
1:39
there's only enough left to last a few
1:41
more months with all of the issues
1:44
facing Americans at home why is this
1:47
worth it if Ukraine loses and Putin wins
1:50
I think you would be certainly
1:52
increasing if not doubling your defense
1:53
budget in the years ahead and you will
1:55
increase the probability of a great
1:57
power war in the next 10 to 15 years I
1:58
think it' be a very dangerous situation
2:00
if if Putin's allowed to win Ukraine
2:01
Russia obviously is what drives this
2:04
meeting today the chairman of the Joint
2:06
Chiefs is the commander and Chief's
2:08
principal military adviser but commands
2:11
no troops in battle I am obligated uh
2:14
regardless of consequences to give my
2:15
advice to the president but no president
2:17
is obligated to follow that advice this
2:19
past August General Millie invited us to
2:21
board the USS Constitution in Boston
2:24
Harbor not far from where he grew up
2:27
we're the only uh military in the world
2:29
that swear an oath not to a king a queen
2:31
a tyrant a wouldbe tyrant or a dictator
2:34
we swear an oath to an idea the idea
2:36
that is American it's and it's embodied
2:38
in that document the Constitution which
2:39
sets up our form of government in 2021
2:42
General Millie had counseled President
2:44
Biden to keep 2,500 troops in and around
2:48
Cobell instead Mr Biden ordered a
2:51
complete withdrawal to end America's
2:54
longest war after 20 years the disaster
2:57
that followed will be part of both of
2:59
their legacies I go through the entire
3:03
uh withdrawal from uh Afghanistan
3:05
chapter and verse all the time that was
3:08
a a strategic failure for the United
3:09
States the enemy occupied the capital
3:11
city of the country that you were
3:13
supporting so to me uh that hurts it
3:15
hurts a big way but no matter what pain
3:17
I feel or anyone else feels nothing
3:19
comes even close to the pain of those
3:21
that were killed to those who served in
3:23
Afghanistan for two decades and lost
3:26
family members and friends and wonder
3:29
was it worth it that's always the
3:32
question right so 2461 killed in action
3:36
by the enemy in Afghanistan over 20
3:38
years was it worth it look at I can't
3:40
answer that for other people this is a
3:42
tough business that we're in this
3:43
military business it's unforgiving The
3:45
Crucible of combat's unforgiving people
3:47
die they lose their arms they lose their
3:49
legs it's an incredibly difficult uh
3:52
life but is it worth it look around you
3:55
uh look ask yourself the question uh for
3:58
me I've answered it many many times over
4:00
and that's why I stay in uniform and
4:01
that's why I maintain my oath his
4:03
commitment to that oath would be both
4:04
tested and questioned by Donald Trump
4:08
while their relationship began with kind
4:10
words uh Mark Milly he's a great
4:12
gentleman he's a great Patriot he's a
4:14
great Soldier after the January 6th
4:17
Insurrection the two men would not speak
4:19
again what do we want we their public
4:22
estrangement started in the spring of
4:24
2020 when protests for racial Justice
4:27
some violent spread across the country
4:30
including to Washington DC perhaps more
4:33
than any other chairman in the role you
4:35
have become ins snarled in politics and
4:39
arguably threats to the Constitution
4:41
what have you learned from that well I
4:43
think it's important to to keep your
4:45
North Star which is the Constitution we
4:47
the military are not only apolitical we
4:51
are nonpartisan you can't pick sides
4:53
June 1st 2020 was that a turning point
4:56
for you as chairman I think it was yeah
4:58
I realized that
5:00
stepped into a political Minefield and I
5:02
shouldn't
5:03
have he's talking about the day when
5:05
President Trump threatened to invoke the
5:07
Insurrection act and deploy the US Army
5:10
to put down the unrest on America's
5:13
streets on the evening of June 1st after
5:16
demonstrators near the White House were
5:18
removed by
5:21
force chairman Millie dressed in battle
5:24
fatigues joined president Trump and
5:26
members of his cabinet in a march across
5:29
lafay Square to St John's Church where
5:31
Mr Trump posed for
5:34
photographs 10 days later General Millie
5:37
apologized in a speech to graduates of
5:39
the National Defense University my
5:41
presence in that moment and in that
5:43
environment created a perception of the
5:46
military involved in domestic Politics
5:49
as a commissioned uniformed officer it
5:51
was a mistake that I have learned from
5:53
it's rare for a chairman to apologize
5:55
publicly well you know I grew up here in
5:57
Boston I'm Irish Catholic and my mother
6:00
and father taught me that when you make
6:02
a mistake you admit it you got a
6:03
confession you say 10 hell Mar is an Al
6:04
father everybody makes mistakes and and
6:07
the key is how you deal with a mistake
6:09
after you apologized former president
6:11
Trump said you choked like a
6:13
dog yeah I'm not going to comment on
6:15
anything the former president has said
6:17
or not said General Millie did tell us
6:19
he was so disillusioned with the former
6:22
president's actions he nearly resigned
6:25
instead according to Former Defense
6:27
secretary Mark esper he and the general
6:29
made a pact to protect the military from
6:32
becoming politicized or misused it's
6:35
also been reported that you spent
6:37
several days several drafts of
6:39
resignation letters right I was very
6:42
struck by the one that was published in
6:44
which you said to the president it is my
6:46
deeply held belief that you are ruining
6:48
the international order causing
6:51
significant damage to our country
6:52
overseas that was fought so hard by the
6:55
greatest Generation in
6:57
1945 that generation has fought against
6:59
fascism has fought against Nazism has
7:02
fought against extremism it's now
7:04
obvious to me that you don't understand
7:07
that World Order you don't think Donald
7:10
Trump understood what World War II was
7:12
fought over I don't know what uh
7:15
president former president Trump uh
7:18
understood about World War II or or or
7:20
or anything else uh I I can tell you
7:23
that from 1914 to
7:25
1945 150 million people or thereabouts
7:29
were slaughtered in the conduct of great
7:30
power war and in 1945 the United States
7:33
took the initiative and drafted up a set
7:36
of rules that govern the world to this
7:37
day those rules are under stress
7:40
internationally President Putin is a
7:42
direct frontal assault on those rules uh
7:45
China is trying to revise those rules to
7:47
their own benefit but that's one thing
7:48
to say that China is threatening that
7:50
World Order and Russia is threatening
7:52
that world order to say that the
7:54
Commander in Chief Donald Trump was
7:57
ruining the international order in
7:59
causing significant damage what did you
8:02
see that caused you to write that I I
8:04
would say that it's got to be more than
8:05
walking into Lafayette Square and
8:07
uniform there was a wide variety of
8:09
initiatives that were ongoing one of
8:11
them of course was with drawing troops
8:13
out of NATO those were initiatives that
8:16
placed at risk um you know I think
8:19
America's rolling the world now that is
8:21
uh the opposite of uh what my parents
8:24
and and uh 18 million others wore the
8:27
uniform for World War II to defeat
8:29
General Millie doesn't just Revere the
8:31
greatest Generation he was raised by it
8:34
his father was a Navy medic who served
8:36
in the Pacific Campaign including at the
8:39
Battle of iima his mother joined the
8:41
naval Reserve to work as a
8:44
nurse well this was and Still Remains a
8:47
very patriotic neighborhood after the
8:49
war they settled in Winchester a small
8:51
town north of Boston almost every
8:54
single uh male and female parent that
8:57
was here they're all World War Two
8:59
Veterans of one kind or another the
9:01
whole block really a lot ofbody yeah
9:03
100% and interesting no officers uh
9:06
these were all 100% enlisted and they
9:08
had their own opinions of officers too
9:10
including your parents right oh yeah
9:12
yeah during high school he was recruited
9:14
to play ice hockey at Princeton
9:16
University and decided to join The
9:18
Reserve officer training Corps or
9:21
Roc after graduating in 1980 he went on
9:24
to become a paratrooper and serve in
9:26
Special Forces he did one com tour in
9:29
Iraq and three in Afghanistan raise your
9:32
right hand this past may he returned to
9:35
Princeton to commission the graduating
9:37
Roc class congratulations to every one
9:40
of you and took a particular interest
9:43
all right Cadets in a few of the young
9:45
officers whose language skills are
9:47
currently in high demand I speak Chinese
9:50
sir Chinese is really really important
9:51
to us does anybody else speak Chinese
9:54
whoa 1 two 3 4 five if you speak Chinese
9:58
if you don't mind I'd like to get your
10:00
names uh and we'll see where life takes
10:03
you guys we the United States need to
10:05
take the challenge the military
10:07
challenge of China extraordinarily
10:09
seriously how concerned are you that
10:12
military to military Communications are
10:15
not happening right now with China yeah
10:17
I think we need to get that established
10:18
uh we had them for a period of time and
10:20
they've dropped off so channels of
10:22
communication are important in order to
10:24
deescalate in time of Crisis general
10:26
Millie says he held a total of five
10:29
calls with his Chinese military
10:31
counterparts during the Trump and Biden
10:33
administrations but it was his last two
10:35
calls during the final months of the
10:37
Trump presidency that got the attention
10:40
of the press Congress and the former
10:43
president himself why did you think it
10:45
was so important to call your Chinese
10:48
military counterpart in the aftermath of
10:50
the January 6th attacks that's an
10:52
example of deescalation so there was
10:54
clear indications uh that the Chinese
10:56
were very concerned about what they were
10:58
observing here in the United States you
11:01
see some movement of Chinese military
11:03
equipment I w't go over anything
11:04
classified um so I won't discuss exactly
11:07
what we saw or didn't see or what we
11:09
heard or didn't hear I will just say
11:11
that uh there was clear indications that
11:13
the Chinese are very concerned president
11:15
Trump recently said that your dealings
11:17
with China were so egregious that in
11:20
Times Gone by the punishment would have
11:23
been
11:26
death that's right he said that but for
11:29
the record was there anything
11:30
inappropriate or treasonous about the
11:32
calls you made to China absolutely not
11:34
zero none and not only that they were
11:36
authorized and they coordinated uh
11:37
Congress knows that we've answered these
11:39
questions several different times in
11:40
writing were you giving the Chinese
11:42
information about thinking of the
11:43
president of the United States the
11:45
specific conversation was I think in
11:48
accordance with the intent of the
11:49
Secretary of Defense which was to make
11:51
sure the Chinese knew that we were not
11:53
going to attack them why did the Chinese
11:55
think that the US under then president
11:57
Trump was going to attack them the
11:58
Chinese were concerned about uh what
12:00
what is commonly referred to in in the
12:02
English language like an October
12:04
surprise Wag the Dog sort of thing uh
12:06
they were wrong they were not reading us
12:08
right look at the president Trump was
12:10
not going to attack China uh and they
12:12
needed to know that China Russia and the
12:15
war in Ukraine are now the problem of
12:18
his successor Air Force General Charles
12:21
Q Brown
12:23
Jr there are also areas of concern
12:25
closer to home last year the Army missed
12:29
recruiting numbers by 15,000 Soldiers
12:32
the worst shortfall in decades
12:35
confidence in the US military is at its
12:37
lowest in two decades do you bear any
12:40
personal responsibility for that
12:42
absolutely I think I think as the leader
12:44
of the military the uniform military I
12:46
think that I am part of that for sure I
12:48
think the walk from the White House to
12:50
the St John's Church I think that uh
12:52
helped create some of that I think the
12:54
withdrawal from Afghanistan uh helped
12:56
create some of that but I would also say
12:57
the United States military is still one
12:59
of the most respected institutions in
13:01
the United States by a long shot uh by
13:04
huge margin you know I I think we've uh
13:06
taken a slip back a little bit and I
13:07
think we need to improve on
13:12
that General Mark Milly on the future of
13:15
warfare does it make war more likely it
13:19
could at 60 Minutes overtime.com in the
13:22
character of War which is
