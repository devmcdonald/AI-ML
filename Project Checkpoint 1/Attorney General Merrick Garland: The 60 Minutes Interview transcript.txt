0:01
not since Watergate has an attorney
0:04
general been at the center of such a
0:07
firestorm Merrick Garland's justice
0:09
department is Prosecuting both former
0:11
president Trump and the son of President
0:15
Biden caught in the middle is this
0:17
70-year-old former prosecutor and
0:19
well-respected judge with a long history
0:22
as a moderate we met Garland Friday in
0:26
Washington he told us that he devoted
0:29
his life to the rule of law because of
0:32
his family's struggle to escape the
0:35
Holocaust now he's responsible for
0:37
prosecutions that will shape the future
0:39
of the nation in a rare interview the
0:42
Attorney General told us that in the
0:44
Trump and Biden trials ahead his
0:48
prosecutors will pursue Justice without
0:51
fear and without
0:54
favor the story will continue in a
0:58
moment
1:00
we do not have one rule for republicans
1:03
and another rule for Democrats we don't
1:05
have one rule for foes and another for
1:07
friends we don't have one rule for the
1:10
powerful another for the powerless for
1:12
the rich or for the poor based on
1:14
ethnicity we have only one rule and that
1:16
one rule is that we follow the facts and
1:18
the law and we reach the decisions
1:20
required by the Constitution and we
1:22
protect civil liberties are you
1:24
essentially saying as attorney general
1:26
to the American people trust me well in
1:30
the end I I suppose it does in the end
1:32
come down to trust but it's not just me
1:35
it's Decades of the of the Norms of this
1:38
department that are part of the DNA of
1:40
the career prosecutors who are running
1:43
the investigation um and supervising the
1:45
investigations that you're talking about
1:48
former president Trump faces two Federal
1:51
trials one for allegedly hoarding
1:54
classified documents and covering it up
1:57
the other for allegedly conspiring to
1:59
see power after the 2020 election
2:03
attorney general Garland has said little
2:05
about this and we wanted to understand
2:08
why well I think the first thing to
2:11
understand is because these are pending
2:12
cases because there are two federal
2:15
indictments the long-standing rule in
2:17
the Justice Department is that we can't
2:19
comment about pending cases where does
2:21
that rule come from what's the point one
2:23
reason is to protect the privacy and
2:25
civil liberties of the person who's
2:27
under investigation it's to protect
2:29
Witnesses who also may or may not become
2:32
public later in an investigation and
2:35
then finally it's to protect the
2:36
investigation itself um investigations
2:40
proceed in many different directions
2:42
eventually coming to a fruition a
2:44
decision to charge or not charge about a
2:47
particular thing or not and if Witnesses
2:49
and potential subjects knew everything
2:52
that the investigators had previously
2:54
looked at and we about to look at it
2:56
could well change testimony it could
2:59
well make make Witnesses unavailable to
3:01
us and this is not peculiar to the Trump
3:04
investigations well this is a rule for
3:05
all investigations this is part of what
3:07
we call our Justice manual it's been
3:10
there for probably at least 30 years and
3:12
probably longer than that help us
3:15
understand the
3:16
timing these prosecutions of the former
3:19
president are happening during the
3:21
campaign you could make the argument
3:23
that it's the worst possible
3:26
time the justice department has general
3:29
practice IES about not making
3:31
significant overt steps or charging
3:34
within a month or so of an election we
3:37
are clearly outside that uh that time
3:40
frame uh in these cases um prosecutors
3:44
special counsel they follow the facts in
3:47
the law where they lead when they've
3:50
gotten the amount of evidence necessary
3:53
to make a charging decision and have
3:55
decided that a charge is warranted
3:56
that's when they bring their cases the
3:59
investig ation itself has determined the
4:01
timing yes exactly right your critics
4:04
say that it's time to ruin Mr Trump's
4:07
chances in the election well that's
4:10
absolutely not true justice department
4:12
prosecutors are nonpartisan they don't
4:15
allow partisan considerations to play
4:17
any role in their determinations the
4:19
prosecutor in the Trump cases is Jack
4:22
Smith he was named by Garland to be
4:25
special counsel that's a job under the
4:28
regulations of the justice department
4:31
designed to give Smith broad
4:33
independence from the department and
4:35
from the White House the most important
4:39
aspect of the regulations is that the
4:41
special councel is not subject to the
4:43
day-to-day supervision of anyone in the
4:46
Justice Department you are not in
4:49
communication with the president or any
4:51
member of his administration with regard
4:53
to the investigation of former president
4:55
Trump no I am not if President Biden
4:59
asked you you to take action with regard
5:02
to the Trump investigation what would
5:05
your reaction be I am sure that that
5:07
will not happen um but I would not uh do
5:11
anything um in that regard um and if
5:13
necessary I would resign but I there is
5:16
no sense that anything like that will
5:18
happen have you ever had to tell him
5:21
hands off these investigations Mr
5:23
President no because he has never tried
5:25
to put hands on these investigations
5:28
separately president President Biden
5:30
himself is the subject of a special
5:32
councel investigation into whether he
5:35
improperly held classified documents
5:38
after he was vice president his son
5:41
Hunter Biden is the target of a 4year
5:45
investigation into his business deals
5:48
and his taxes he's been indicted for
5:51
lying about drug abuse when he bought a
5:54
gun Republicans accus special counsel
5:58
David Weiss of slow walking the hunter
6:01
Biden investigation the allegation is Mr
6:05
attorney
6:06
general that what is described in some
6:10
quarters as the Biden justice
6:13
department is taking it easy on the
6:15
president's son well look um this
6:19
investigation began under David Weiss uh
6:22
David Weiss is a long-standing career
6:25
prosecutor and he was appointed by Mr
6:27
Trump as the United State's Attorney uh
6:30
for the District of Delaware I promised
6:32
at my nomination hearing that I would
6:35
continue him on in that position uh and
6:37
that I would not interfere with this
6:39
investigation you are not participating
6:42
in those decisions no Mr Weiss is making
6:44
those decisions the White House is not
6:46
attempting to influence those decisions
6:48
absolutely not and he said we won't have
6:51
to take his word for it under justice
6:54
department regulations a special counsel
6:57
must write a final report which I will
7:01
make public to the extent um permissible
7:04
under the law um that is required to
7:07
explain their prosecutive decisions
7:10
their decisions to prosecute or not
7:11
prosecute and their strategic decisions
7:14
along the way usually the special
7:16
councils have testified at the end of
7:18
their reports and I expect that that
7:20
will be the case here how's your
7:21
relationship with the president it must
7:24
be
7:25
Frosty I have a good working
7:27
relationship with the president good
7:29
perhaps but maybe not close the
7:33
president addressed the question in
7:35
August when he spotted Garland at a
7:37
White House Event attorney general
7:39
Garland haven't seen you in a long while
7:41
good to see you Secretary of homelet you
7:43
think I'm kidding I'm
7:47
[Music]
7:49
not attorney general Garland leads
7:53
115,000 employees prosecutors agents of
7:57
the FBI and other federal law
7:59
enforcement additional security is now
8:02
assigned to protect judges and
8:04
prosecutors after the Trump cases Drew
8:07
death threats political violence is
8:10
among Garland's gravest
8:13
concerns people can argue with each
8:15
other as much as they want and as
8:18
vociferously as they want but the one
8:21
thing they may not do is use violence
8:23
and threats of violence to alter the
8:25
outcome and an important aspect of this
8:27
is the American people themselves the
8:29
American people must protect each
8:35
other they must
8:37
ensure that they treat each
8:41
other with Civility and kindness listen
8:44
to opposing views argue as vifer usly as
8:47
they want but refrain from violence and
8:50
threats of violence that's the only way
8:51
this democracy Will Survive why do you
8:54
feel so strongly about
8:56
that well I feel it for a number of
8:58
reasons and number of things that I've
9:00
seen but for my own family who who uh
9:04
fled uh religious persecution in Europe
9:07
um and some members who did not
9:13
uh survive when they got to the United
9:19
States the United States
9:24
protect it guaranteed uh that they could
9:28
practice their religion they could vote
9:31
they could do all the things they
9:33
thought a democracy would provide um
9:36
that's the difference between this
9:38
country and many other countries and
9:41
it's my responsibility it's the Justice
9:43
Department's responsibility to ensure
9:45
that that difference continues that we
9:47
protect each
9:48
other two of your ancestors were
9:52
murdered in the
9:56
Holocaust yes is that why you devoted
9:59
yourself to the
10:00
law yes uh that's I would say that's why
10:03
I devoted myself to the rule of law uh
10:06
to Public Service uh to try and to
10:09
ensure that the rule of law um um
10:12
governs this country and continues to
10:14
govern this country Merrick Garland has
10:17
spent a life in the law m e r r i c k g
10:21
a r l a n d he's the associate Deputy
10:24
attorney general at Justice he oversaw
10:26
the Oklahoma City bombing case at Act of
10:29
political terrorism later after nearly
10:33
two decades as a federal appeals court
10:35
judge he was nominated to the US Supreme
10:38
Court by President Obama but Republicans
10:41
stalled the nomination for 10 months
10:44
until Donald Trump was sworn in
10:47
president-elect Biden picked Garland for
10:49
Attorney
10:50
General on the same day the capital was
10:54
attacked that became one of the largest
10:57
investigations in the Department's
10:59
history we've U arrested and brought
11:02
charges against more than 1,00 uh people
11:06
um there are uh more to come um the
11:10
videos that uh every single person uh
11:13
happen to have on their phones uh that
11:15
security cameras had that bystanders had
11:18
that the media had at the time uh
11:20
disclosed faces some of which we have
11:22
not yet been able to connect uh to
11:24
people you're looking for new suspects
11:26
new defendants still yeah there it's not
11:29
that they're new suspects but there they
11:31
are people that we haven't found yet why
11:33
do these prosecutions mean so much to
11:35
you because this is a fundamental aspect
11:38
of our democracy if we can't ensure that
11:41
this kind of behavior doesn't recur it
11:43
will occur the prosecutions we bring are
11:46
deterrence against that from happening
11:49
Garland knows he will be vilified no
11:52
matter how the Trump and Biden cases are
11:54
decided his job he told us was to take
11:57
the arrows for the Department he has
12:00
learned to embrace the pain that comes
12:02
with the job the youngest right now is
12:05
Riot Mitchell Forever 8 months old and
12:08
we saw that at DEA headquarters where he
12:11
was surrounded by those lost to the
12:14
opioid epidemic is the attorney general
12:17
and their grieving families meeting them
12:20
he told us reminds him of why he fights
12:24
and whom he is fighting for thank you
12:27
for being here and listening to us I
12:29
represent the American people um I don't
12:32
represent the president I represent the
12:34
American people and likewise I am not
12:37
congress's prosecutor I work for the
12:40
American
12:41
people and if democracy is an emotional
12:45
subject for Merrick Garland maybe it's
12:47
because he has witnessed how suddenly it
12:50
can be threatened in Oklahoma City and
12:54
Washington
12:55
DC when the history of this
12:58
extraordinary time is written what is
13:01
the best that Merrick Garland can hope
13:05
for look I think it's the best any
13:07
public servant can hope for that we've
13:09
done our best that we pass on a justice
13:13
department that uh continues to pursue
13:16
the rule of law and protect it uh and
13:19
it's it's the same thing that every
13:20
generation has to Hope um that we can
13:24
pass our democracy on in working order
13:28
um to the next uh generation that picks
13:31
up the torch and is responsible when
13:34
we're finished uh to continue that
13:41
job
