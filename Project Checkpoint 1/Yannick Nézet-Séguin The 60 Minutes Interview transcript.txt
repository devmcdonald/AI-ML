0:10
orchestras in Philadelphia in his

hometown of Montreal and in the
0:15
Metropolitan Opera in New York which is
0:17
pinned on him the hopes for rebounding
0:20
from financial crisis in the Bold
0:22
revamping of its artistic Mission not
0:25
that you'll catch naysay sagath sweating
0:27
it at 48 he's obliterating The
0:29
Stereotype of the strict unapproachable
0:31
Maestro joyfully keeping his musicians
0:34
in time his hair bleached platinum
0:37
blonde in a smile all but welded to his
0:39
face known as much for his versatility
0:42
as his virtuosity Sega as we first told
0:45
you in May is reimagining the role of
0:48
the modern Orchestra and its place in
0:50
the soundtrack of the modern city
0:54
the story will continue in a moment
1:02
[Music]
1:04
forgiven for double checking your ticket
1:06
to make sure you weren't at Madison
1:07
Square Garden this is New York's
1:10
Metropolitan Opera
1:13
and in this corner the Maestro yanique
1:16
de Zay Sagan only the third music
1:19
director in the Mets 140-year history
1:26
he's conducting a jazz infused Opera
1:30
about a real-life boxing champion of the
1:32
1960s and 70s all this is a radical key
1:35
change from the standard met lineup of
1:37
Puccini and Verdi in Wagner
1:41
oh
1:42
[Applause]
1:44
nice again's eyes reach musicians in the
1:47
pit in vocalists on stage seemingly all
1:50
at once the bounce in his baton
1:52
consecrates every note
1:56
this is the cathartic moment where oh my
1:59
God this is so amazing this is so
2:01
impressive this is so intense this is so
2:04
emotional and this cathartic experience
2:07
we feel transformed
2:09
as a different person before and after
2:11
listening to these pieces there seems to
2:14
be something
2:15
sacred about your making music by
2:18
overstating that no no you're not I try
2:22
never to take myself too seriously but
2:24
music has to be taken seriously
2:26
a Pianist by training who's conducted
2:29
the great philharmonics of Europe Nazi
2:31
Sega brings his sensibility to Bear up
2:34
and down the Eastern seaboard
2:38
Philadelphia he is the current custodian
2:40
of what's been a world-renowned
2:42
Orchestra for more than a century we
2:44
visited in February as the city
2:47
celebrated the contract extension
2:49
through 2030 of a maestro known to All
2:51
by his first name
2:54
that morning
2:56
yanique and his musicians made the
2:58
pilgrimage up the famed Rocky steps clad
3:01
in Eagles gear he sees the orchestra not
3:04
unlike a sport team as an instrument of
3:06
cohesion in the community hey hi
3:09
everyone Hi in the afternoon naze Saga
3:12
stopped by Philly's Premier performing
3:14
arts high school to guest conduct the
3:16
students
3:18
if we were to agree to bite even more in
3:22
every note like
3:25
[Music]
3:32
450 miles due north back home in
3:35
Montreal
3:35
[Applause]
3:37
they speak his language in more ways
3:40
than one he is a lifetime contract with
3:42
the orchest Metropolitan Daisy Sega has
3:45
led these musicians for more than 20
3:47
years that's his husband Pierre turville
3:50
on viola the depth of his connection
3:52
here produces hypnotic sound listen to
3:56
this a rehearsal of sibelius's Fifth
3:58
Symphony
4:09
thank you
4:13
some weeks yanique leads performances in
4:16
all three cities just last Saturday he
4:19
conducted a matinee in New York and the
4:21
evening program in Philly then again
4:23
what is a conductor if not someone able
4:26
to synchronize I can't deny that it's a
4:30
very demanding schedule and even the
4:33
word schedule if should I ever retire I
4:36
want to ban that word from my life do
4:38
you have a favorite child among the
4:40
three orchestras you conduct
4:42
you cannot ask me this
4:49
yet one child in particular and isn't
4:52
this always the case demands extra
4:54
attention and TLC can we have more
4:57
importance in the third party
5:00
at the Met the country's largest
5:03
Performing Arts institution we watched
5:05
him Wrangle 250 musicians and singers
5:08
for a production of vodkar's lowengrid a
5:11
stalwart Opera that gave us the bridal
5:13
chorus
5:16
in naze sagaz interpretations do right
5:19
by the Masters what I want is to respect
5:23
what Wagner wrote in the score
5:27
so it's very poetic and magical what's
5:30
really individual is me being completely
5:32
at the surface of the composer
5:34
took over the podium here in 2018 after
5:37
his predecessor was fired for
5:39
allegations of sexual misconduct facing
5:42
weak ticket sales and perpetually
5:44
strapped for cash the Met has had a hard
5:46
time rebounding from covid and is dipped
5:48
into its endowment to cover around 10
5:50
percent of its 300 million dollar
5:52
operating budget Maestro to the pit
5:55
please they've tried courting a younger
5:57
more diverse crowd here before but
5:59
naysay sagaz doing it prestissimo
6:01
speeding up the tempo of change he's
6:04
betting that new composers and
6:06
contemporary operas some adapted from
6:08
best-selling books and Hollywood Hits
6:10
will bring in a wider audience and Shore
6:12
up the bottom line and early results
6:15
suggest tease right
6:18
yeah
6:19
a recent premiere of the Opera fire Shut
6:22
Up In My Bones based on a memoir by
6:24
journalist Charles blow and composed by
6:27
jazz legend Terence Blanchard sold out
6:29
and outsold Verdi's classic Rigoletto
6:32
here that season what's more half the
6:35
seats were filled by first time met
6:37
goers it's great such a success and yet
6:40
I'm thinking that means that all of
6:42
these people never felt compelled or
6:45
dare I say welcome to come here and that
6:49
is my mission the first timers were 50
6:52
you saw that as both a Triumph but also
6:55
sounds like an indictment mostly it's a
6:58
tremendous encouragement to continue in
7:00
that Vein The Met will put on 17 new and
7:04
recent works over the next five seasons
7:06
this at a place that once went near
7:08
decades without staging a new Opera this
7:11
spring brought Champion another Terence
7:13
Blanchard composition based on the
7:15
complicated life of Emile Griffin a
7:17
bisexual prize fighter what can't you
7:20
write an opera about
7:23
nothing how do you thread that needle
7:26
between
7:27
experimenting and bringing in new
7:29
audiences but also not upsetting the
7:31
traditionalists the truth is I'm not
7:35
necessarily concerned about not
7:37
upsetting traditionalists I think people
7:39
who love our art form are still going to
7:42
love it because we're still going to
7:44
play some Puccini and Verdi to me it's
7:46
it's never about not upsetting and if
7:49
some people are upset well too bad they
7:51
just don't have to come to everything we
7:52
do and that's about as prickly as you'll
7:55
hear him get Beyond yanique's
7:57
musicianship his real Hallmark might be
7:59
his light touch okay let's do it one
8:01
more time take this rehearsal for
8:03
Champion the first time the orchestra
8:05
Rhythm Section and singers played the
8:07
piece together but also that rare
8:09
collaboration between a conductor and a
8:12
living composer he gets it Terence
8:15
Blanchard a seven-time Grammy winner is
8:17
the first black composer in the Mets
8:19
history he gets the story he gets the
8:21
whole notion of bringing these different
8:23
styles of music together
8:26
one of the rehearsals with the orchestra
8:29
he said listen
8:30
don't follow me listen to the drums most
8:33
conductors don't do that I'm there for
8:36
you okay cool we saw firsthand yannick's
8:39
responsiveness when soprano Latonya
8:42
Moore asked him to slow things down
8:45
[Music]
8:51
we go in here slower I just want to
8:53
really get everything out yeah so right
8:56
from the base
8:58
is there a worry though that your
9:00
Authority might be undercut by all these
9:03
Good Vibes I think it's the old concept
9:05
of authority which is because uh I say
9:09
so and because I can fire you I'm gonna
9:12
tell you what to do that's not working
9:14
anymore and I will go even further even
9:16
the masters of the past Toscanini for
9:19
example
9:20
fantastic musician of course I respect a
9:23
lot of this but you can hear when some
9:25
recordings with Toscanini especially
9:28
with singers you could hear the fear in
9:31
their voice and to me that's not
9:33
expressive you can discern that oh yeah
9:35
oh I'm sure you could
9:37
oh like they're trembling because they
9:40
fear because already to open your mouth
9:43
on the stage is already nerve-wracking
9:45
if you have a conductor who's waiting
9:47
for you to fail it's going to be even
9:49
more nerve-wracking the music doesn't
9:51
win
9:52
[Music]
9:54
the music wins when everybody feels free
9:58
to express who they are
10:00
yanique found that freedom for himself
10:03
his earliest grade school
10:06
here he is leading an imaginary
10:08
Orchestra in front of classmates
10:10
he studied at the conservatory in
10:12
Montreal a music town with a church on
10:15
every corner he led the church choir in
10:17
his teens and trained his ear in less
10:19
formal ways too I would go to a record
10:22
store and buy CDs and discover
10:25
repertoire after repertoire every
10:27
Symphony by Brahms every Symphony by
10:28
Beethoven by Bruckner by mother I wanted
10:31
then to hear every version and by every
10:34
version of every Symphony and I'm not
10:36
shy to say that it it's it's shaped a
10:39
lot of who I am as a musician because
10:41
eventually I became a collection of like
10:44
12 000 CDs last winter we visited his
10:47
parents at yanique's childhood home the
10:50
kind of folks who keep every clipping
10:52
Ian told us when he was a boy he
10:54
collected thousands and thousands maybe
10:56
10 000 CDs more than that he wasn't
10:59
exaggerating no no no no no not at all
11:01
not that tall where did you put them he
11:04
made their shelves
11:05
and it was his mom who managed janik's
11:08
schedule throughout his 30s as he were
11:10
worked the international circuit London
11:13
Vienna Rotterdam guests conducting 100
11:15
orchestras
11:19
he made his met debut in 2009
11:21
persistence paying off and if today he's
11:24
living the dream he's also conscious to
11:27
live his life he and Pierre go on the
11:29
road together we met them at a spot in
11:32
Old Montreal where they had celebrated
11:34
their wedding they make a point of going
11:36
out after every performance friends
11:38
family members of the orchestra
11:41
colleagues some people together to eat
11:45
well and drink a little
11:49
moments in the couple's history we were
11:52
surprised when yanique highlighted this
11:54
one
11:57
at the time Pierre and Celine Dion
11:59
serenaded him on a popular Quebec talk
12:01
show a kind of musical this is your life
12:04
of course it's one of the most moving
12:06
moments of my life not everybody can say
12:08
that they've sung a uh duet
12:13
and Barbra Streisand
12:16
um
12:17
[Laughter]
12:20
maybe it's a hard turn from Celine to
12:22
the Met for most conductors not so for
12:25
yanique
12:26
yes he takes music seriously but resists
12:30
being too precious about it you have to
12:32
trust the Acoustics he's too busy
12:34
smudging boundaries that have long kept
12:36
some audiences away from classical music
12:38
and Opera
12:42
foreign
12:48
I would love that when I finish my time
12:51
on Earth that no one ever says again oh
12:55
classical music is not for me it's for
12:57
the educated it's for the rich it's for
12:59
the white whatever it is you know I want
13:02
everyone to feel oh yeah I could like it
13:04
some of it I don't like Mozart but I
13:06
like Blanche fine but at least you feel
13:09
that you could go there because there
13:11
would be something for you what would
13:13
Puccini and Verdi and Wagner make of all
13:16
this one suspects they would join in the
13:18
Applause they after all were Once
13:20
musical boundary pushers too
13:22
