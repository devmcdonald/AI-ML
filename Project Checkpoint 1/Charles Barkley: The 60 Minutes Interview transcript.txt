0:04
in his Hall of Fame NBA career Charles
0:07
Barkley accumulated 12
0:09
546 rebounds but he pulled the ultimate
0:12
rebound when he finished playing
0:14
equaling maybe even eclipsing his
0:17
considerable skills on a basketball
0:18
court with his singular talent in a TV
0:21
studio
0:22
for the last 23 years Barkley has been
0:25
delivering witty blunt provocative
0:27
opinions on every imaginable topic often
0:30
imparted with a smile always imparted
0:32
with I don't give a damn if you agree
0:34
with me Candor imagine Mark Twain with a
0:37
low post game as we first reported in
0:39
March despite his lack of a tongue
0:42
editor maybe because of it Barkley Now
0:44
60 seems cancel proof granted license to
0:48
go right up to that mid-court line of
0:50
acceptability even to stomp over it
0:52
sometimes it's made him more relevant
0:54
than ever it's made him dare we say it
0:57
an American treasure
1:00
the story will continue in a moment
1:06
why do you suppose people want to listen
1:07
to you
1:08
[Laughter]
1:13
I think they know that I'm gonna be
1:15
honest
1:16
I'm gonna be fair
1:18
I don't have a hidden agenda
1:21
not many people on TV that you can set
1:23
out about
1:24
what's up everybody what's up
1:28
you don't have a chance to win every
1:30
year that's one of the biggest lies ever
1:32
told
1:34
60 nights a year Charles Barkley is the
1:37
go-to guy on TNT's Inside the NBA I like
1:41
this do people like you think our team
1:43
sucks I'm like uh yeah I only think that
1:45
because they suck a path breaking Emmy
1:48
dominating show that makes for riveting
1:50
unscripted TV you big dummy
1:54
you're fun up there it's just basketball
1:57
we're not solving inflation we didn't
2:00
just get back from Afghanistan but
2:02
you're not a used car salesman either I
2:04
mean if the game's no good you'll admit
2:06
it oh yeah because the fans ain't stupid
2:08
they just saw it if I tell them that was
2:11
a good game they're gonna be like what
2:12
the hell is Charles talking about you
2:13
said sometimes you've even fallen asleep
2:15
on the set oh I fall asleep man like
2:17
just sitting there watching like oh man
2:19
this is just bad basketball you know I'm
2:21
gonna raise some hell around here this
2:23
is what America has come to expect from
2:25
Charles Barkley we have to talk about
2:28
the Lakers the Lakers are awful for
2:30
Chuck it's just I'm going to let it fly
2:31
and if you don't like it tough
2:34
five four
2:36
Ernie Johnson is the longtime host of
2:38
Inside the NBA Charles is down there
2:41
well how many times do you say we're oh
2:43
where's this going we'll start a show
2:45
and Charles will look at me and say I
2:48
got to get something off my chest
2:50
it could be something that involves a
2:53
world peace or the Brooklyn Nets or it
2:56
could be something he could be upset
2:58
that his plumber showed up late and he
3:01
just has to get it off his chest we got
3:03
to be serious on this show sometime but
3:05
if Barkley brings levity he also brings
3:08
gravity
3:09
Memphis Grizzly Star John Morant was
3:12
suspended in March after this Instagram
3:14
live video showed him flashing a gun at
3:17
a strip club Barkley used it to make a
3:19
broader Point guns especially in the
3:21
black community the way we killing each
3:24
other it's just really unfortunate and
3:26
sad and we got to it's always been a
3:29
problem but it seemed like it's gotten
3:30
worse in the last few years black on
3:32
black crime and the way we've been
3:33
killing each other Barkley may be at his
3:35
most visible in the studio in Atlanta
3:39
but for a fuller sense of the man head
3:42
two hours West to his hometown of Leeds
3:44
Alabama
3:46
I'm telling y'all I did not name the
3:48
street after myself
3:50
you didn't Lobby for Charles Dickens for
3:52
Charles Barkley Avenue
3:54
we interviewed Barkley in the home he
3:56
still keeps in town
3:59
it's a few hundred yards from where he
4:01
grew up you were angry that your dad
4:04
left the family when you were one years
4:05
old I was very angry
4:08
and I was even angrier because he kept
4:10
saying he was going to send us money
4:12
and he didn't do it because like you
4:16
know my Mom and Grandma were working
4:17
their behinds off and the thing that was
4:20
really bad about it I was stand by the
4:23
uh mailbox like once every three or four
4:26
months waiting for the checks yes but
4:27
they never came his indomitable Grandma
4:30
Johnny may who helped raise him still
4:33
inspires stories when Charles and his
4:35
buddies get together in Leeds shoot
4:37
granted was the real deal
4:42
really yeah yeah
4:45
and she had one too so we were really
4:48
poor we didn't know it at the time so to
4:50
make ends meet
4:51
she sold alcohol where
4:54
in the house had a shot house out of
4:57
your house yeah so people would come
4:59
over Friday and Saturday and play cards
5:03
everybody starts drinking once somebody
5:05
lose their money there's gonna be a
5:07
fight so my grandmother's little old
5:09
lady she's walking around with a sex
5:11
shooter and she's keeping the peace
5:14
I didn't even know any better John I
5:16
thought this was normal stuff
5:18
well yeah
5:21
I think it's time for a new floor
5:23
Barkley also took us to his old Junior
5:26
High Gym it stands barely as a symbol of
5:29
how far he's come 14 15 year old Charles
5:32
Barkley walking in here who's that kid
5:35
he's uh five nine five ten big boned not
5:40
Pat big boned chubby whatever words you
5:43
want to use I'm a 510 backup point guard
5:47
you remember specific plays and shots
5:50
from playing here Ty game we got you on
5:53
the wing yeah it's a tie game I'm not
5:55
going to be in the game let's get that
5:56
let's get that out the way a six inch
5:58
growth spurt helped turn Barkley into a
6:00
high school basketball star
6:03
but his formative teenage experience
6:05
came at the school football stadium wow
6:09
this is where he stood alone at a
6:11
distance watching his classmates
6:13
graduate I flunked Spanish
6:16
so I didn't graduate I was at home all
6:19
by myself devastated
6:22
and I drove around the back side here
6:24
and I stood here for two hours and
6:26
watched the graduation
6:28
I cried the whole time
6:30
even now it's kind of hit me in a in the
6:34
heart a little bit man what a traumatic
6:37
night that was you remember the name of
6:39
the teacher I miss Gomez I'll never
6:41
forget that and Miss Gomez when I go
6:44
back and think was one of the sweetest
6:46
kindest people
6:48
I'd ever met in my life but in that
6:51
moment I was so mad
6:53
because you know I wanted to throw my
6:55
hat in the air too he graduated thanks
6:57
to summer school
7:01
at Auburn he was a star yes for his
7:03
skills but also for his heroic appetite
7:06
he embraced his nickname the round mound
7:08
of rebound
7:13
drafted in 1984 he became a charismatic
7:16
NBA star for the Philadelphia 76ers
7:20
he's the shortest man ever to lead the
7:22
NBA in rebounding proof that for all
7:25
Barkley's Yachts he played with Fury
7:28
I was playing to stick it to my dad Miss
7:33
Gomez and some of the kids who had made
7:36
fun of me instead of just wanting to be
7:38
great at basketball what's firing up
7:41
this furnace is the anger you have for
7:43
your Spanish teacher that flunked you
7:44
yes and your dad yes 100 what caused you
7:48
to flush out this anger and get
7:50
motivated for a different reason the
7:52
spin incident in New Jersey in 1991 he
7:56
spat at a Heckler and inadvertently hit
7:58
a young girl he calls it the low point
8:01
of his career I got suspended rightfully
8:03
so I was sitting in my hotel room
8:08
and I was like
8:10
you are
8:12
The Biggest Loser in the world
8:16
I I remember saying this is it tonight
8:19
anyone I am only going to play
8:21
basketball because I'm great at it and I
8:24
love to play I'm getting all the dirt
8:26
off my shoulders Miss Gomez bye Dad bye
8:31
that was really the turning point for me
8:37
Barkley was the NBA's MVP in 1993 for
8:41
the Phoenix Suns
8:43
and then months after retiring in 2000
8:46
he embarked on a broadcasting career
8:48
number one there's no dominant team full
8:52
disclosure you may have seen him on this
8:54
network working March Madness
8:56
what do you make of the college game
8:57
today it's a travesty and a disgrace
9:01
I'm so mad now how we can mess up
9:04
something that's so beautiful and we
9:06
mess it up we can't pay
9:09
all these players
9:10
translation Barkley hates the new wild
9:14
west of college sports where players go
9:16
to the schools that can bid the highest
9:19
in the next three to five years we're
9:22
going to have 25 schools that's going to
9:25
dominate the sports because they can
9:27
afford players
9:29
and these schools who can't afford or
9:32
won't pay players are going to be
9:35
irrelevant
9:36
almost a quarter Century since Barkley
9:38
last played and now for my opinion his
9:41
opinions free of varnish still matter
9:44
does Kevin Durant a great great player
9:46
if you ain't driving the bus don't walk
9:49
around talk about Julia Champion his
9:50
takes don't always go over well Kevin
9:53
Durant to Perennial All-Star one said of
9:55
Barkley I don't know why they still ask
9:57
for this idiot's opinion Kevin Durant
10:00
he's very sensitive
10:02
great player he's part of that
10:04
generation who think he can't be
10:06
criticized
10:07
he's never looked in the mirror and says
10:09
man was that a fair criticism
10:11
we're in agreement today's players are a
10:14
little more sensitive to criticism than
10:15
yours that would be an understatement
10:17
today's players take offense but so if
10:19
players from your generation it's been
10:21
been a while since you and Michael
10:22
Jordan spoke Michael disagreed with
10:24
something I said and he broke off the
10:25
Friendship born three days apart Barkley
10:28
and Jordan were once the best of friends
10:30
but as Jordan struggled as owner of the
10:32
Charlotte Hornets Barkley mints no words
10:35
and what I said I think that he don't
10:38
have enough people around him are going
10:39
to tell him
10:40
no
10:42
and he got really offended
10:45
and we haven't spoken but John I really
10:49
I'm gonna do my job because I have zero
10:53
credibility
10:55
if I criticize other people in the same
10:58
boat
11:00
and not criticize my best friend even if
11:02
you have nothing to apologize for you
11:05
think of just picking up the phone and
11:06
trying to repair this thing with Michael
11:08
I got an ego too John
11:11
you can't be great at something like you
11:14
that doesn't get it right to be a jerk
11:15
you think you'll resolve this eventually
11:19
he got my number
11:21
if you really want to get Barkley going
11:23
on disappointment ask him about his
11:25
daughter Cristiano's basketball skills
11:27
your daughter's not a basketball player
11:30
that was
11:33
that was brutal
11:34
she was six feet tall from from birth
11:37
[Laughter]
11:39
I'm gonna have the best female
11:41
basketball player in the world
11:44
I can't wait to she's old enough I'm
11:46
gonna teach her everything
11:48
and then we start playing and I'm
11:51
sitting in the stands and I'm saying to
11:53
myself oh man
11:55
she is not aggressive at all
11:57
so I asked her one day I said you don't
12:00
like basketball do you she's all dead I
12:02
hate basketball
12:03
and I said oh okay
12:06
and it took me a little while to get
12:09
over that because you're being serious
12:10
now yeah but she's a great person and a
12:13
straight A student so I had to brag
12:15
about that I guarantee that makes you
12:17
feel every bit as good as her hitting a
12:19
game-winning jumper not quite but it's
12:22
close enough
12:25
Christiana now 34 recently had a son
12:28
Henry the new grandpa says he's never
12:31
felt Joy like this when we arrived he
12:33
broke out this video
12:38
it is by far and away the greatest thing
12:41
that's ever happened to me in my life
12:42
lives up to the hype it lives up to the
12:45
hype I want to spend time with him
12:50
because
12:51
I'm not morbid I'm not upset
12:55
I'm on the back nine I hope I'm gonna
12:58
hold 10 or 11. but you never know I
13:02
could be on 17 and 18. so I want to
13:05
spend as much time with him as possible
13:08
and then when he gets older I want him
13:11
to Google me Google me kid yeah do you
13:14
know who I am I hope he does some
13:17
research on me I'll be long gone but I
13:20
would like him to know that I
13:22
accomplished some things in my life
13:28
I got to live my dream Charles Barkley
13:32
on gratitude if you think I'm better or
13:35
I work harder you're just stupid at 60
