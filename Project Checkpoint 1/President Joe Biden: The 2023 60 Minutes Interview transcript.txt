0:01
rarely does a president confront so much
0:04
Peril the catastrophe in Israel the war
0:07
in Ukraine and no help from a paralyzed
0:10
Congress late Thursday we met President
0:13
Biden at the White House it had been a
0:15
rough week and we could see it on him Mr
0:18
Biden will be 81 next month and he has
0:20
said that when he's tired his lifelong
0:23
stutter can creep back in but he wedged
0:26
us into his schedule to express his
0:29
commit to Israel after the massacre of
0:32
more than a thousand civilians 8 days
0:35
ago 29 Americans were killed 15 are
0:39
missing and at least a small number of
0:41
them are known to have been taken
0:44
hostage in a video call on Friday Mr
0:47
Biden had this message for Americans in
0:49
Israel whose loved ones have
0:54
vanished the story will continue in a
0:58
moment
1:00
we saying we're going to do everything
1:02
in our power to find those who are still
1:05
alive and set them free everything in
1:07
our power and uh I'm not going to go
1:10
into the detail of that but there's uh
1:12
we're working like hell on it why do you
1:15
feel so strongly about speaking to these
1:18
families personally on Zoom because I
1:21
think they have to know that the
1:23
president of United States of America
1:25
cares deeply about what's happening
1:27
deeply we have to communicate to the
1:30
world this is critical this is not even
1:32
human behavior it's it's it's pure
1:35
barbarism and we're going to do
1:37
everything on our power to get them home
1:38
if we can find them Friday's hourlong
1:42
call with 14 families included a father
1:45
who told us the president answered
1:48
desperate pleas with empathy and
1:51
patience is getting the American
1:53
hostages back safely among your highest
1:56
priorities now of course it is but it's
1:58
hard to hard to make this distinctions
2:00
the the most important
2:02
thing is
2:04
ending this
2:06
brutality and to hold those who
2:09
committed it
2:10
accountable to confront the brutality Mr
2:14
Biden ordered two aircraft carriers plus
2:16
Cruisers and destroyers to the region
2:20
there are about 900 US troops in Syria
2:24
on a counterterrorism mission since
2:27
2015 can you foresee US troops in combat
2:32
in this new middle EAS War I I don't
2:35
think that's necessary Israel has one of
2:37
the finest fighting forces in the
2:39
country I guarantee we're going to
2:40
provide them everything they need
2:43
because of what we're seeing in the
2:44
Middle East is the threat of terrorism
2:47
in the United States increased yes I had
2:50
a meeting this morning with the homeland
2:54
security people with the FBI for The
2:57
Situation Room for better part of an
3:00
hour to discuss how we make sure that we
3:02
prevent a lone wolf Andor any Co
3:06
coordinated effort to try to do what was
3:09
done in synagogues before do what was
3:11
done to Jews in the street and so we're
3:15
we're making a major effort to make sure
3:17
that doesn't
3:18
happen Saturday October 7th has been
3:21
called Israel's 911 more than 1,000
3:26
Hamas terrorists from Gaza smashed
3:28
through a border to commit mass murder
3:32
families in their homes crowds at a
3:36
concert people in the
3:41
street Israel is striking back with the
3:44
largest bombardment of Gaza ever more
3:47
than 2,000 have been killed by gaza's
3:50
count certainly about 12200 Israeli
3:53
civilians were killed in the initial
3:55
attack but now Hamas Fighters and
3:59
Palestinian civilians are being killed
4:02
in the
4:03
Counterattack is it time for a cease
4:05
fire now look there's a fundamental
4:09
difference Israel is going after a group
4:12
of people who engaged in barbarism that
4:14
is as consequential as the
4:18
Holocaust and uh so I think Israel has
4:21
to respond they have to go after Hamas
4:23
now Hamas is a bunch of cowards they're
4:25
hiding behind the civilians they put
4:28
their off their their their headquarters
4:31
where civilians are and buildings and
4:33
the like but to the extent that they can
4:35
separate out and avoid I'm confident the
4:38
Israelis are going to do everything in
4:39
their power to avoid the the killing of
4:43
innocent
4:44
civilians Hamas is an islamist terrorist
4:48
group and the government of Gaza Gaza is
4:52
25 mil long and averages 5 Mi wide
4:56
Israel severely limits its economy so
4:59
most gazin are destitute now Israel has
5:03
cut off food fuel electricity and most
5:06
water and has ordered 1 million gazin to
5:10
evacuate to the southern half of Gaza
5:13
the UN warns of a humanitarian
5:16
disaster there are about 2 million
5:18
people in Gaza as you know Mr President
5:21
2 million people trapped about half of
5:23
them are children are you asking Israel
5:26
to establish a humanitarian corridor in
5:29
that area or get humanitarian supplies
5:32
yes our team is talking with them about
5:34
that and uh whether there could be a
5:36
safe Zone we're also talking with the
5:39
Egyptians uh whether there's an outlet
5:41
to get these children and and women out
5:45
uh um
5:48
into out of the that area at this moment
5:52
but it's it's hard you would like to see
5:55
a humanitarian Corridor that allows some
5:58
of the 2 million go CS out of the area
6:01
yes you would like to see humanitarian
6:04
supplies brought into Gaza yes so you do
6:08
not agree with the Israeli total Siege
6:11
of the Gaza Strip I'm confident that
6:14
Israel is going to act under the major
6:16
the the rules of War there there's a
6:19
standard that Democratic institutions
6:21
and countries go go by and so uh I'm I'm
6:26
confident that there's going to be an
6:28
ability for the Innocents in Gaza to be
6:32
able to have access to medicine and food
6:35
and
6:36
water would you support Israeli
6:39
occupation of Gaza at this point I think
6:42
it'd be a big mistake look what happened
6:45
in Gaza in my view is Hamas and the
6:49
extreme elements of Hamas don't
6:52
represent all the Palestinian people and
6:55
uh I think that uh it would be a mistake
6:59
take to uh for Israel to occupy Gaz
7:04
again we did but to going in and taking
7:06
out the uh the extremist the uh
7:12
Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down
7:15
south is a necessary requirement do you
7:19
believe that Hamas must be eliminated
7:21
entirely yes I do but there needs to be
7:26
a Palestinian Authority there needs to
7:28
be a
7:30
a path to a Palestinian
7:33
state that path called the two-state
7:36
solution has been US policy for decades
7:39
it would create an independent nation
7:42
next to Israel for 5 million
7:45
Palestinians who live in Gaza and on the
7:48
West Bank of the Jordan River and you
7:50
believe Israel would pursue that after
7:54
what's occurred not now not now but but
7:57
I think Israel understands that
8:00
significant portion of Palestinian
8:01
people do not share the views of Hamas
8:04
and Hezbollah Hezbollah is a powerful
8:07
islamist militia to Israel's North which
8:11
is armed and trained by Iran Iran also
8:14
supports Hamas there's limited fighting
8:18
already on the Northern Israeli border
8:20
and I wonder what is your message to
8:23
Hezbollah and its backer Iran
8:27
don't don't don't
8:30
don't don't come across the border don't
8:32
escalate this war that's right is Iran
8:36
behind the Gaza War I don't want to get
8:38
into classified information but to be
8:40
very blunt with you there is no clear
8:43
evidence of that at this point no
8:45
evidence that Iran is behind any of this
8:47
correct now Iran constantly supports
8:50
Hamas and Hezbollah I don't mean that
8:52
but in terms of were they did they have
8:54
for knowledge did they help plan the
8:57
attack they there there's no evidence of
8:59
that at this point the president is
9:02
asking for billions of dollars for
9:04
Israel and
9:06
Ukraine but Congress is paralyzed
9:10
hard-right Republicans are obstructing
9:12
the election of a speaker of the house
9:14
does the dysfunction that we've seen in
9:18
Congress increase the danger in the
9:20
world yes
9:24
look this is not your father's
9:26
Republican party 30% of is made up of
9:30
these maget Republicans who are maybe
9:34
democracy is something I don't they
9:35
don't look at it the same way you and I
9:37
look at democracy are the wars in Israel
9:40
and Ukraine more than the United States
9:43
can take on at the same time we the
9:44
United States of America for God's
9:47
sake the most powerful nation in the
9:49
history not in the world in the history
9:51
of the world the history of the world we
9:54
can take care of both of these and still
9:56
maintain our overall International
9:58
defense Russia's unprovoked Invasion
10:01
occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine hundreds
10:04
of thousands have been killed or
10:07
wounded in an interview last month
10:10
president volodimir zalinski told us he
10:13
could lose without
10:15
usaid how do these wars in Israel and
10:18
Ukraine relate to the safety of the
10:22
American people overwhelmingly they
10:24
relate for example in Ukraine one of my
10:26
objectives was to prevent Putin who has
10:31
committed war crimes himself who from
10:34
being able to occupy an independent
10:37
country that borders NATO allies and is
10:40
on the Russian border imagine what
10:43
happens now if he were able to succeed
10:46
have you ever known a major war in
10:47
Europe we didn't get sucked into we
10:49
don't want that to happen we want to
10:52
make sure those democracies are
10:54
sustained and Ukraine is critical in
10:57
making sure that happens
11:00
Mr Biden told us images of October 7th
11:03
reminded him of the Holocaust which he
11:06
has studied taking his family to the
11:09
dohow death camp in Germany this is 2015
11:13
the man in the wheelchair is a dock
11:15
house Survivor behind Mr Biden is the
11:19
president's granddaughter I wanted my
11:22
children and grandchildren to fully
11:24
understand exactly what happened and why
11:27
you couldn't deny
11:29
Carnage going on if you were living in
11:31
Germany and in Europe why do you feel so
11:35
strongly what does Israel mean to
11:39
you the Jews have been subject to abuse
11:44
Prejudice
11:45
and attempt to wipe them out for over
11:50
thousand years for me it's about decency
11:54
respect honor it's just it's just simply
11:57
wrong wrong wrong wrong it violates
12:01
every religious principle I have in
12:03
every way and every single principle my
12:05
father taught me as we spoke to the
12:08
president his secretary of state was in
12:10
Israel his defense secretary was at a
12:13
NATO meeting on Ukraine America's oldest
12:16
president seemed tired from directing
12:18
all of this but he was very clear on
12:22
what he stood for and how his policies
12:25
in his view would see America through
12:29
Mr President given these two Wars and
12:32
the dysfunction in Congress are you sure
12:36
that you want to run
12:37
again yes because I'm
12:40
sure
12:42
look when I ran I said the world's at an
12:45
inflection point the world's changing
12:49
but we have an opportunity to make it so
12:51
imagine if we were able to succeed in
12:54
getting the Middle East put in place
12:56
where we have normalization of relations
12:59
I think we can do that imagine what
13:01
happens if we fact unite all of Europe
13:04
and Putin is finally put down where he
13:07
cannot cause the kind of trouble he's
13:09
been causing we have enormous
13:11
opportunities enormous opportunities to
13:13
make it a better
13:18
world more from President Biden is the
13:22
effort to normalize relations between
13:24
Israel and Saudi Arabia now dead no at
